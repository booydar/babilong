       "'\\nwhich remind us of days far earlier. Edward the Fourth and Richard the\\nThird were chosen Kings, or at least had their claims to the Crown\\nacknowledged, by gatherings of the citizens of London which remind us\\nof the wars of Stephen and Matilda(59). Still even in this age, the\\npower of Parliament was advancing(60); the anxiety of every pretender\\nto get a parliamentary sanction for his claims was a sign of the\\ngrowing importance of Parliament, and we get incidental notices which\\nshow that a seat in the House of Commons, and that not as a knight of a\\nshire, but as a burgess of a borough, was now an object of ambition for\\nmen of the class from which knights of the shire were chosen, and even\\nfor the sons of members of the Upper House(61). At last came the sixteenth century, the time of trial for parliamentary\\ninstitutions in so many countries of Europe. Daniel travelled to the kitchen. Not a few assemblies which\\nhad once been as free as our own Parliament were, during that age,\\neither utterly swept away or reduced to empty formalities. Then it\\nwas that Charles the Fifth and Philip the Second overthrew the free\\nconstitutions of Castile and Aragon; before long the States-General\\nof France met for the last time before their last meeting of all\\non the eve of the great Revolution(62). In England parliamentary\\ninstitutions were not swept away, nor did Parliament sink into an empty\\nform. But, for a while, Parliaments, like all our other institutions,\\nbecame perverted into instruments of tyranny. Under Henry the Eighth,\\nParliaments, like Judges, Juries, and ecclesiastical Synods, decreed\\nwhatever seemed good to the caprice of the despot. Why had they so\\nfallen away from what they had been in a past age, from what they\\nwere to be again? The reason is plain; the Commons had not yet gained\\nstrength enough to act without the Lords, and the Lords had ceased to\\nbe an independent body. The old nobility had been cut off at Towton\\nand Barnet, and the new nobility were the abject slaves of the King\\nto whom they owed their honours. A century later, the new nobility\\nhad inherited the spirit of the old, and the Commons had grown to the\\nfulness of their power. Thus it came that we find in the Parliaments\\nof the sixteenth century an abject submission to a tyrant’s will, of\\nwhich we find no sign in the Parliaments either of the fourteenth or\\nof the seventeenth. Very different indeed from the Parliaments which\\noverthrew Richard the Second and Charles the First were the Parliaments\\nwhich, almost without a question, passed bills of attainder against\\nany man against whom Henry’s caprice had turned, the Parliaments\\nwhich, in the great age of religious controversy, were ever ready\\nto enforce by every penalty that particular shade of doctrine which\\nfor the moment commended itself to the Defender of the Faith, to his\\nson or to his daughters. Why, it may be asked, in such a state of\\nthings, did not parliamentary institutions perish in England as they\\nperished in so many other lands? It might be enough to say that no\\nruler had an interest in destroying institutions which he found that\\nhe could so conveniently turn to his own purposes. But why did not\\nthose institutions sink into mere forms, which they certainly did not\\ndo, even in the worst times? One reason undoubtedly is that special\\ninsular position of our country which has in so many other ways\\ngiven a peculiar turn to our history. The great foe of parliamentary\\ninstitutions was the introduction of standing armies. But the sovereign\\nof England, shut up within his island, had far less need of a standing\\narmy than the sovereigns of the Continent, engaged as they were in\\ntheir ceaseless wars with neighbours on their frontiers. But I believe\\nthat the personal character of Henry the Eighth had a great deal to\\ndo with the final preservation of our liberties. Do not for a moment\\nfancy that I belong to that school of paradox which sets up Henry the\\nEighth as a virtuous and beneficent ruler. Do not think that I claim\\nfor him any feelings of direct thankfulness such as I do claim for\\nEarl Simon and King Edward. The position of Henry is more like the\\nposition of William the Conqueror, though I certainly hold that the\\nConqueror was in everything the better man of the two. Both served the\\ncause of freedom indirectly, and both served it by means of features\\nin the personal character of each. In one respect indeed William and\\nHenry stood in utterly different positions towards England. William was\\na stranger, and it was largely because he was a stranger that he was\\nable to do us indirect good. Henry, with all his crimes, was a thorough\\nEnglishman; throughout his reign there was a sympathy between him and\\nthe mass of his subjects, who, after all, did not greatly suffer by the\\noccasional beheading of a Queen or a Duke. But the despotism of William\\nand the despotism of Henry agreed in this, that each, even in his worst\\ndeeds, retained a scrupulous regard for the letter of the Law. Sandra went back to the bathroom. In the\\ncase of William this is not hard to see for any one who carefully\\nstudies the records of his age(63); in the case of Henry it stands\\nboldly proclaimed in the broadest facts of English history. While his\\nfellow-tyrants abroad were everywhere overthrowing free institutions,\\nHenry was in all things showing them the deepest outward respect. Throughout his reign he took care to do nothing except in outward and\\nregular legal form, nothing for which he could not shelter himself\\nunder the sanction either of precedent or of written Law. In itself,\\nthis perversion of Law, this clothing of wrong with the garb of right,\\nis really worse—at all events it is more corrupting—than deeds of open\\nviolence against which men are tempted openly to revolt. But such a\\ntyranny as Henry’s is one form of the homage which vice pays to virtue;\\nthe careful preservation of the outward forms of freedom makes it\\neasier for another and happier generation again to kindle the form into\\nits ancient spirit and life. Every deed of wrong done by Henry with the\\nassent of Parliament was in truth a witness to the abiding importance\\nof Parliament; the very degradation of our ancient Constitution was a\\nstep to its revival with new strength and in a more perfect form(64). A like witness to the importance of Parliament in this age was shown\\nin two other very remarkable ways, whereby the power and importance of\\nthe House of Commons was acknowledged in the very act of corrupting\\nit. Sandra went to the kitchen. One was the active interference of the Government in parliamentary\\nelections; the other was the creation of boroughs in order to be\\ncorrupt. One needs no stronger proofs than these of the importance\\nof the body which it was found needful thus to pack and to manage. The Crown still kept the power of summoning members from any boroughs\\nwhich it thought fit, and throughout the Tudor reigns the power was\\nfreely abused by sending writs to places which were likely to return\\nmembers who would be subservient to the Court(65). Thus arose many\\nof the wretched little boroughs in Cornwall and elsewhere which were\\ndisfranchised by our successive Reform Bills. These boroughs, which\\nalways were corrupt and which were created in order to be corrupt, must\\nbe carefully distinguished from another class which perished with them. Many towns to which Earl Simon and King Edward sent writs decayed in\\nprocess of time; sometimes they decayed positively; more commonly they\\ndecayed relatively, by being utterly outstripped by younger towns and\\nso losing the importance which they had once had. The disfranchisement\\nof both classes was equally just; but the different history of the two\\nclasses should be carefully borne in mind. It was right to take away\\nits members from Old Sarum, but there had been a time when it was right\\nto give Old Sarum members. In the case of a crowd of Cornish boroughs,\\nit not only was right to take away their members, but they never ought\\nto have had members at all(66). It was in the days of Elizabeth that something of the ancient spirit\\nagain breathed forth. It is then that we come to the beginning of that\\nlong line of parliamentary worthies which stretches on in unbroken\\norder from her days to our own. A few daring spirits in the Commons’\\nHouse now began once more to speak in tones worthy of those great\\nAssemblies which had taught the Edwards and the Richards that there\\nwas a power in England mightier than their own(67). Under the puny\\nsuccessor of the great Queen the voice of freedom was heard more\\nloudly(68). In the next reign the great strife of all came, and a King\\nof England once more, as in the days of Henry and Simon, stood forth\\nin arms against his people to learn that the power of his people was\\na greater power than his. But in the seventeenth century, just as in\\nthe thirteenth, men did not ask for any rights and powers which were\\nadmitted to be new; they asked only for the better security of those\\nrights and powers which had been handed on from days of old.

       "'If all this effort and\\nexpenditure had resulted in success, it would be possible to keep\\nsilent and shrug one\\'s shoulders; but when the mode of undertaking\\nthis expedition can be clearly shown to have been the direct cause of\\nits failure, silence would be a crime. When Lord Wolseley told the\\nsoldiers at Korti on their return from Metemmah, \"It was not _your_\\nfault that Gordon has perished and Khartoum fallen,\" the positiveness\\nof his assurance may have been derived from the inner conviction of\\nhis own stupendous error. The expedition was finally sanctioned in August, and the news of its\\ncoming was known to General Gordon in September, before, indeed, his\\nown despatches of 31st July were received in London, and broke the\\nsuspense of nearly half a year. He thought that only a small force was\\ncoming, under the command of Major-General Earle, and he at once, as\\nalready described, sent his steamers back to Shendy, there to await\\nthe troops and convey them to Khartoum. He seems to have calculated\\nthat three months from the date of the message informing him of the\\nexpedition would suffice for the conveyance of the troops as far as\\nBerber or Metemmah, and at that rate General Earle would have arrived\\nwhere his steamers awaited him early in November. Sandra moved to the kitchen. Gordon\\'s views as to\\nthe object of the expedition, which somebody called the Gordon Relief\\nExpedition, were thus clearly expressed:--\\n\\n     \"I altogether decline the imputation that the projected\\n     expedition has come to relieve me. It has come to save our\\n     National honour in extricating the garrisons, etc., from a\\n     position in which our action in Egypt has placed these garrisons. As for myself, I could make good my retreat at any moment, if I\\n     wished. Now realise what would happen if this first relief\\n     expedition was to bolt, and the steamers fell into the hands of\\n     the Mahdi. This second relief expedition (for the honour of\\n     England engaged in extricating garrisons) would be somewhat\\n     hampered. We, the first and second expeditions, are equally\\n     engaged for the honour of England. I came up\\n     to extricate the garrison, and failed. Earle comes up to\\n     extricate garrisons, and I hope succeeds. Earle does not come to\\n     extricate me. The extrication of the garrisons was supposed to\\n     affect our \"National honour.\" If Earle succeeds, the \"National\\n     honour\" thanks him, and I hope recommends him, but it is\\n     altogether independent of me, who, for failing, incurs its blame. I am not _the rescued lamb_, and I will not be.\" Lord Wolseley, still possessed with the idea that, now that an\\nexpedition had been sanctioned, the question of time was not of\\nsupreme importance, and that the relieving expedition might be carried\\nout in a deliberate manner, which would be both more effective and\\nless exposed to risk, did not reach Cairo till September, and had only\\narrived at Wady Halfa on 8th October, when his final instructions\\nreached him in the following form:--\"The primary object of your\\nexpedition is to bring away General Gordon and Colonel Stewart, and\\nyou are not to advance further south than necessary to attain that\\nobject, and when it has been secured, no further offensive operations\\nof any kind are to be undertaken.\" It had,\\nhowever, determined to leave the garrisons to their fate, despite the\\nNational honour being involved, at the very moment that it sanctioned\\nan enormous expenditure to try and save the lives of its\\nlong-neglected representatives, Gordon and Colonel Stewart. With\\nextraordinary shrewdness, Gordon detected the hollowness of its\\npurpose, and wrote:--\"I very much doubt what is really going to be the\\npolicy of our Government, even now that the Expedition is at Dongola,\"\\nand if they intend ratting out, \"the troops had better not come beyond\\nBerber till the question of what will be done is settled.\" The receipt of Gordon\\'s and Power\\'s despatches of July showed that\\nthere were, at the time of their being written, supplies for four\\nmonths, which would have carried the garrison on till the end of\\nNovember. As the greater part of that period had expired when these\\ndocuments reached Lord Wolseley\\'s hands, it was quite impossible to\\ndoubt that time had become the most important factor of all in the\\nsituation. The chance of being too late would even then have presented\\nitself to a prudent commander, and, above all, to a friend hastening\\nto the rescue of a friend. The news that Colonel Stewart and some\\nother Europeans had been entrapped and murdered near Merowe, which\\nreached the English commander from different sources before Gordon\\nconfirmed it in his letters, was also calculated to stimulate, by\\nshowing that Gordon was alone, and had single-handed to conduct the\\ndefence of a populous city. Hard on the heels of that intelligence\\ncame Gordon\\'s letter of 4th November to Lord Wolseley, who received it\\nat Dongola on 14th of the same month. The letter was a long one, but\\nonly two passages need be quoted:--\"At Metemmah, waiting your orders,\\nare five steamers with nine guns.\" Did it not occur to anyone how\\ngreatly, at the worst stage of the siege, Gordon had thus weakened\\nhimself to assist the relieving expedition? Even for that reason there\\nwas not a day or an hour to be lost. But the letter contained a worse and more alarming passage:--\"We can\\nhold out forty days with ease; after that it will be difficult.\" Forty\\ndays would have meant till 14th December, one month ahead of the day\\nLord Wolseley received the news, but the message was really more\\nalarming than the form in which it was published, for there is no\\ndoubt that the word \"difficult\" is the official rendering of Gordon\\'s,\\na little indistinctly written, word \"desperate.\" In face of that\\nalarming message, which only stated facts that ought to have been\\nsurmised, if not known, it was no longer possible to pursue the\\nleisurely promenade up the Nile, which was timed so as to bring the\\nwhole force to Khartoum in the first week of March. Rescue by the most\\nprominent general and swell troops of England at Easter would hardly\\ngratify the commandant and garrison starved into surrender the\\nprevious Christmas, and that was the exact relationship between\\nWolseley\\'s plans and Gordon\\'s necessities. The date at which Gordon\\'s supplies would be exhausted varied not from\\nany miscalculation, but because on two successive occasions he\\ndiscovered large stores of grain and biscuits, which had been stolen\\nfrom the public granaries before his arrival. The supplies that would\\nall have disappeared in November were thus eked out, first till the\\nmiddle of December, and then finally till the end of January, but\\nthere is no doubt that they would not have lasted as long as they did\\nif in the last month of the siege he had not given the civil\\npopulation permission to leave the doomed town. From any and from\\nevery point of view, there was not the shadow of an excuse for a\\nmoment\\'s delay after the receipt of that letter on 14th November. With the British Exchequer at a commander\\'s back, it is easy to\\norganise an expedition on an elaborate scale, and to carry it out with\\nthe nicety of perfection, but for the realisation of these ponderous\\nplans there is one thing more necessary, and that is time. I have no\\ndoubt if Gordon\\'s letter had said \"granaries full, can hold out till\\nEaster,\" that Lord Wolseley\\'s deliberate march--Cairo, September 27;\\nWady Halfa, October 8; Dongola, November 14; Korti, December 30;\\nMetemmah any day in February, and Khartoum, March 3, and those were\\nthe approximate dates of his grand plan of campaign--would have been\\nfully successful, and held up for admiration as a model of skill. Unfortunately, it would not do for the occasion, as Gordon was on the\\nverge of starvation and in desperate straits when the rescuing force\\nreached Dongola. It is not easy to alter the plan of any campaign, nor\\nto adapt a heavy moving machine to the work suitable for a light one. To feed 10,000 British soldiers on the middle Nile was alone a feat of\\norganisation such as no other country could have attempted, but the\\neffort was exhausting, and left no reserve energy to despatch that\\nquick-moving battalion which could have reached Gordon\\'s steamers\\nearly in December, and would have reinforced the Khartoum garrison,\\njust as Havelock and Outram did the Lucknow Residency. Dongola is only 100 miles below Debbeh, where the intelligence\\nofficers and a small force were on that 14th November; Ambukol,\\nspecially recommended by Gordon as the best starting-point, is less\\nthan fifty miles, and Korti, the point selected by Lord Wolseley, is\\nexactly that distance above Debbeh. The Bayuda desert route by the\\nJakdul Wells to Metemmah is 170 miles. At Metemmah were the five\\nsteamers with nine guns to convoy the desperately needed succour to\\nKhartoum. The energy expended on the despatch of 10,000 men up 150\\nmiles of river, if concentrated on 1000 men, must have given a\\nspeedier result, but, as the affair was managed, the last day of the\\nyear 1884 was reached before there was even that small force ready to\\nmake a dash across the desert for Metemmah. The excuses made for this, as the result proved, fatal delay of taking\\nsix weeks to do what--the forward movement from Dongola to Korti, not\\nof the main force, but of 1000 men--ought to have been done in one\\nweek, were the dearth of camels, the imperfect drill of the camel\\ncorps, and, it must be added, the exaggerated fear of the Mahdi\\'s\\npower. When it was attempted to quicken the slow forward movement of\\nthe unwieldy force confusion ensued, and no greater progress was\\neffected than if things had been left undisturbed. The erratic policy\\nin procuring camels caused them at the critical moment to be not\\nforthcoming in anything approaching the required numbers, and this\\ndifficulty was undoubtedly increased by the treachery of Mahmoud\\nKhalifa, who was the chief contractor we employed. Even when the\\ncamels were procured, they had to be broken in for regular work, and\\nthe men accustomed to the strange drill and mode of locomotion. The\\nlast reason perhaps had the most weight of all, for although the Mahdi\\nwith all his hordes had been kept at bay by Gordon single-handed, Lord\\nWolseley would risk nothing in the field. Probably the determining\\nreason for that decision was that the success of a small force would\\nhave revealed how absolutely unnecessary his large and costly\\nexpedition was. Yet events were to show beyond possibility of\\ncontraversion that this was the case, for not less than two-thirds of\\nthe force were never in any shape or form actively employed, and, as\\nfar as the fate of Gordon went, might just as well have been left at\\nhome. They had, however, to be fed and provided for at the end of a\\nline of communication of over 1200 miles. Still, notwithstanding all these delays and disadvantages, a\\nwell-equipped force of 1000 men was ready on 30th December to leave\\nKorti to cross the 170 miles of the Bayuda desert. That route was well\\nknown and well watered. There were wells at, at least, five places,\\nand the best of these was at Jakdul, about half-way across. The\\nofficer entrusted with the command was Major-General Sir Herbert\\nStewart, an officer of a gallant disposition, who was above all others\\nimpressed with the necessity of making an immediate advance, with the\\nview of throwing some help into Khartoum. Unfortunately he was\\ntrammelled by his instructions, which were to this effect--he was to\\nestablish a fort at Jakdul; but if he found an insufficiency of water\\nthere he was at liberty to press on to Metemmah. His action was to be\\ndetermined by the measure of his own necessities, not of Gordon\\'s, and\\nso Lord Wolseley arranged throughout. He reached that place with his\\n1100 fighting men, but on examining the wells and finding them full,\\nhe felt bound to obey the orders of his commander, viz. to establish\\nthe fort, and then return to Korti for a reinforcement. It was a case\\nwhen Nelson\\'s blind eye might have been called into requisition, but\\neven the most gallant officers are not Nelsons. The first advance of General Stewart to Jakdul, reached on 3rd January\\n1885, was in every respect a success. It was achieved without loss,\\nunopposed, and was quite of the nature of a surprise. The British\\nrelieving force was at last, after many months\\' report, proved to be\\na reality, and although late, it was not too late. If General Stewart\\nhad not been tied by his instructions, but left a free hand, he would\\nundoubtedly have pressed on, and a reinforcement of British troops\\nwould have entered Khartoum even before the fall of Omdurman. But it\\nmust be recorded also that Sir Herbert Stewart was not inspired by the\\nrequired flash of genius. He paid more deference to the orders of Lord\\nWolseley than to the grave peril of General Gordon. Sandra went back to the bathroom. \"Saw her!--the world is crazy, or I am--saw her swallow a powder! How\\ncould you see her do that or anything else? Hasn\\'t she been shut up in\\nthis room for twenty-four hours?\" \"Yes; but with a window like that in the roof, it isn\\'t so very\\ndifficult to see into the room, madam.\" \"Oh,\" she cried, shrinking, \"I have a spy in the house, have I? But I\\ndeserve it; I kept her imprisoned in four close walls, and never came\\nto look at her once all night. I don\\'t complain; but what was it you say\\nyou saw her take? You think she has poisoned herself, and that I had a\\nhand in it!\" \"No,\" I hastened to remark, \"he does not think you had a hand in it. He\\nsays he saw the girl herself swallow something which he believes to have\\nbeen the occasion of her death, and only asks you now where she obtained\\nit.\" I never gave her anything; didn\\'t know she had\\nanything.\" Somehow, I believed her, and so felt unwilling to prolong the present\\ninterview, especially as each moment delayed the action which I felt it\\nincumbent upon us to take. So, motioning Q to depart upon his errand, I\\ntook Mrs. Belden by the hand and endeavored to lead her from the\\nroom. But she resisted, sitting down by the side of the bed with the\\nexpression, \"I will not leave her again; do not ask it; here is my\\nplace, and here I will stay,\" while Q, obdurate for the first time,\\nstood staring severely upon us both, and would not move, though I urged\\nhim again to make haste, saying that the morning was slipping away, and\\nthat the telegram to Mr. \"Till that woman leaves the room, I don\\'t; and unless you promise to\\ntake my place in watching her, I don\\'t quit the house.\" Astonished, I left her side and crossed to him. \"You carry your suspicions too far,\" I whispered, \"and I think you are\\ntoo rude. We have seen nothing, I am sure, to warrant us in any such\\naction; besides, she can do no harm here; though, as for watching her, I\\npromise to do that much if it will relieve your mind.\" \"I don\\'t want her watched here; take her below. \"Are you not assuming a trifle the master?\" If I am, it is because I have something in my\\npossession which excuses my conduct.\" Agitated now in my turn, I held out my hand. \"Not while that woman remains in the room.\" Seeing him implacable, I returned to Mrs. \"I must entreat you to come with me,\" said I. \"'"

Well of all the ungratefullest\n",
      "girls! Is it for us _all_ to have good times with? Patience fairly jumped up and down with excitement. \"When will they\n",
      "begin, and what will they be like? O Paul, just think of the good\n",
      "times we've had _without_ any money 't all! They had reached the strawberry-bed and Patience dropped down in the\n",

      "Winton will be a lot better than good times anywhere else. Winton's\n",
      "such a nice sociable place.\" Pauline settled herself on the top rail of the fence bordering the\n",
      "garden at the back. \"What sort\n",
      "of good times do you mean?\" \"We have such a lot of picnics--year after year!\" \"A nice picnic is always sort of new. Miranda does put up such\n",
      "beautiful lunches. O Paul, couldn't we afford chocolate layer cake\n",
      "_every_ time, now?\" \"And maybe there'll be an excursion somewhere's, and by'n'by there'll\n",

      "\n",
      "\"See here, hold on, Impatience!\" Pauline protested, as the berries\n",
      "disappeared, one after another, down Patience's small throat. \"Perhaps, if you stop eating them all, we can get enough for mother's\n",
      "and father's supper.\" \"Maybe they went and hurried to get ripe for to-night, so we could\n",
      "celebrate,\" Patience suggested. \"Paul, mayn't I go with you next time\n",
      "you go over to The Maples?\" \"I hate 'we'll see's'!\" Patience declared, reaching so far over after a\n",
      "particularly tempting berry, that she lost her balance, and fell face\n",
      "down among them. she sighed, as her sister came to her assistance,\n",

      "------------\n",
      " good time,\" Patience\n",

      "maybe mother wouldn't think it good to have Jane in now and then--for\n",
      "extra work? She likes to work with Miranda--she says\n",
      "Miranda's such a nice lady. \"I'm thinking about other things just now.\" \"I  don't--There's  mother. Goodness, Miranda's got the cloth on!\" To Patience's astonishment, nothing was said at supper, either of Uncle\n",
      "Paul's letter, or the wonderful things it was to lead to. Shaw\n",
      "kept his wife engaged with parish subjects and Pauline appeared lost in\n",
      "thoughts of her own. Patience fidgeted as openly as she dared. Of all\n",
      "queer grown-ups--and it looked as though most grown-ups were more or\n",
      "less queer--father was certainly the queerest. Of course, he knew\n",
      "about the letter; and how could he go on talking about stupid,\n",
      "uninteresting matters--like the Ladies' Aid and the new hymn books? Even the first strawberries of the season passed unnoticed, as far as\n",
      "he was concerned, though Mrs. Shaw gave Patience a little smiling nod,\n",
      "in recognition of them. \"Mother,\" Pauline exclaimed, the moment her father had gone back to his\n",
      "study, \"I've been thinking--Suppose we get Hilary to pretend--that\n",
      "coming home is coming to a _new_ place? We'll think up all the interesting things to do, that we can, and\n",
      "the pretty places to show her.\" \"That would be a good plan, Pauline.\" \"And if she's company, she'll have to have the spare room,\" Patience\n",
      "added. \"Only, mother, Hilary doesn't\n",
      "like the spare room; she says it's the dreariest room in the house.\" \"If she's company, she'll have to pretend to like it, it wouldn't be\n",
      "good manners not to,\" Patience observed. The prospect opening out\n",
      "ahead of them seemed full of delightful possibilities. \"I hope Miranda\n",
      "catches on to the game, and gives us pound-cake and hot biscuits for\n",
      "supper ever so often, and doesn't call me to do things, when I'm busy\n",
      "entertaining 'the company.'\" \"Mother,\" Pauline broke in--\"do keep quiet. Impatience--couldn't we do\n",
      "the spare room over--there's that twenty-five dollars? \"We might make some alterations, dear--at least.\" \"We'll take stock the first thing to-morrow morning. I suppose we\n",
      "can't really start in before Monday.\" \"Hardly, seeing that it is Friday night.\" They were still talking this new idea over, though Patience had been\n",
      "sent to bed, when Mr. Shaw came in from a visit to a sick parishioner. \"We've got the most beautiful scheme on hand, father,\" Pauline told\n",
      "him, wheeling forward his favorite chair. She hoped he would sit down\n",
      "and talk things over with them, instead of going on to the study; it\n",
      "wouldn't be half as nice, if he stayed outside of everything. \"New schemes appear to be rampant these days,\" Mr. Shaw said, but he\n",
      "settled himself comfortably in the big chair, quite as though he meant\n",
      "to stay with them. He listened, while Pauline explained, really listened, instead of\n",
      "merely seeming to. \"It does appear an excellent idea,\" he said; \"but\n",
      "why should it be Hilary only, who is to try to see Winton with new eyes\n",
      "this summer? Maybe Uncle Paul's thought isn't such a bad one, after all.\" \"Paul always believed in developing the opportunities nearest hand,\"\n",
      "Mr. He stroked the head Towser laid against his knee. \"Your mother and I will be the gainers--if we keep all our girls at\n",
      "home, and still achieve the desired end.\" How could she have thought him\n",
      "unheeding--indifferent? \"Somehow, I think it will work out all right,\" she said. \"Anyhow,\n",
      "we're going to try it, aren't we. John travelled to the hallway. Patience thinks it the\n",
      "best idea ever, there'll be no urging needed there.\" Mary journeyed to the bathroom. Pauline went up to bed that night feeling strangely happy. For one\n",
      "thing the uncertainty was over, and if they set to work to make this\n",
      "summer full of interest, to break up the monotony and routine that\n",
      "Hilary found so irksome, the result must be satisfactory. And lastly,\n",
      "there was the comforting conviction, that whatever displeasure her\n",
      "father had felt at first, at her taking the law into her own hands in\n",
      "such unforeseen fashion, had disappeared now; and he was not going to\n",
      "\n",
      "------------\n",
      "stay \"outside of things,\" that was sure. The next morning, as soon as breakfast was over, Pauline ran up-stairs\n",
      "to the spare room. She threw open the shutters of the four windows,\n",
      "letting in the fresh morning air. The side windows faced west, and\n",
      "looked out across the pleasant tree-shaded yard to the church; those at\n",
      "the front faced south, overlooking the broad village street. In the bright sunlight, the big square room stood forth in all its prim\n",
      "orderliness. \"It is ugly,\" Pauline decided, shaking her head\n",
      "disapprovingly, but it had possibilities. No room, with four such\n",
      "generous windows and--for the fire-board must come out--such a wide\n",
      "deep fireplace, could be without them. She turned, as her mother came in, duly attended by Patience. \"It is\n",
      "hideous, isn't it, mother? The paper, I mean--and the carpet isn't\n",
      "much better. It did very well, I suppose, for the visiting\n",
      "ministers--probably they're too busy thinking over their sermons to\n",
      "notice--but for Hilary--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. As to the\n",
      "unattractiveness of the paper--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We must repaper--that's sure; plain green, with a little touch of\n",
      "color in the border, and, oh, Mother Shaw, wouldn't a green and white\n",
      "matting be lovely?\" \"It wouldn't take all the twenty-five, I'm sure. Miranda'll do the\n",
      "papering, I know. Mother, couldn't we\n",
      "have Jane in for the washing and ironing this week, and let Miranda get\n",
      "right at this room? I'll help with the ironing, too.\" Miranda is rather fussy about letting other\n",
      "people do her regular work, you know.\" \"And remember, Pauline, each day is going to bring new demands--don't\n",
      "put all your eggs into one basket.\" We needn't spend anything on this room except for the paper\n",
      "and matting.\" Half an hour later, Pauline was on her way down to the village store\n",
      "for samples of paper. She had already settled the matter with Miranda,\n",
      "over the wiping of the breakfast dishes. Miranda had lived with the Shaws ever since Pauline was a baby, and was\n",
      "a very important member of the family, both in her own and their\n",
      "opinion. She was tall and gaunt, and somewhat severe looking; however,\n",
      "in her case, looks were deceptive. It would never have occurred to\n",
      "Miranda that the Shaws' interests were not her interests--she\n",
      "considered herself an important factor in the upbringing of the three\n",
      "young people. If she had a favorite, it was probably Hilary. \"Hmn,\" she said, when Pauline broached the subject of the spare room,\n",
      "\"what put that notion in your head, I'd like to know! That paper ain't\n",
      "got a tear in it!\" So Pauline went further, telling her something of Uncle Paul's letter\n",
      "and how they hoped to carry his suggestion out. Miranda stood still, her hands in the dish water--\"That's your pa's own\n",
      "brother, ain't it?\" \"And Miranda--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I reckon he ain't much like the minister. Well, me an' Sarah Jane\n",
      "ain't the least bit alike--if we are sisters. I guess I can manage\n",
      "'bout the papering. But it does go 'gainst me, having that sexton\n",
      "woman in. Still, I reckon you can't be content, 'till we get started. Looking for the old gentleman up, later, be you?\" The minister's getting on, and the other one's\n",
      "considerable older, I understand.\" Daniel went back to the bathroom. \"I don't think he will be up,\" Pauline answered; she hadn't thought of\n",
      "that before. Half way down the street, Pauline was overtaken by her younger sister. \"Are you going to get the new things now, Paul?\" \"Of course not, just get some samples.\" \"There's always such a lot of getting ready first,\" Patience sighed. \"Paul, mother says I may go with you to-morrow afternoon.\" \"Only, you've got to promise not to 'hi\n",
      "yi' at Fanny all the way.\" \"You needn't say what we want the new paper for, or anything about what\n",
      "we are planning to do--in the store I mean.\" \"Miranda says you're beginning to put on considerable airs, since\n",
      "you've been turning your hair up, Paul Shaw. When I put my hair up,\n",
      "I'm going on being just as nice and friendly with folks, as before,\n",
      "you'll see.\" Pauline laughed, which was not at all to Patience's liking. \"All the\n",
      "same, mind what I say,\" she warned. Patience asked, as they reached the store. Paul\n",
      "------------\n",
      "ine went through to the little annex devoted to\n",
      "wall papers and carpetings. It was rather musty and dull in there,\n",
      "Patience thought; she would have liked to make a slow round of the\n",
      "whole store, exchanging greetings and various confidences with the\n",
      "other occupants. The store was a busy place on Saturday morning, and\n",
      "Patience knew every man, woman and child in Winton. They had got their samples and Pauline was lingering before a new line\n",
      "of summer dressgoods just received, when the young fellow in charge of\n",
      "the post-office and telegraph station called to her: \"I say, Miss Shaw,\n",
      "here's a message just come for you.\" \"For me--\"  Pauline took it wonderingly. Her hands were trembling, she\n",
      "had never received a telegram before--Was Hilary? Boyd would have first been\n",
      "obliged to come in to Winton. Out on the sidewalk, she tore open the envelope, not heeding Patience's\n",
      "curious demands. It was from her uncle, and read--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have some one meet the afternoon train Saturday, am sending you an aid\n",
      "towards your summer's outings.\" \"Oh,\" Pauline said, \"do hurry, Patience. I want to get home as fast as\n",
      "I can.\" CHAPTER IV\n",
      "\n",
      "BEGINNINGS\n",
      "\n",
      "Sunday afternoon, Pauline and Patience drove over to The Maples to see\n",
      "Hilary. They stopped, as they went by, at the postoffice for Pauline\n",
      "to mail a letter to her uncle, which was something in the nature of a\n",
      "very enthusiastic postscript to the one she had written him Friday\n",
      "night, acknowledging and thanking him for his cheque, and telling him\n",
      "of the plans already under discussion. \"And now,\" Patience said, as they turned out of the wide main street,\n",
      "\"we're really off. I reckon Hilary'll be looking for us, don't you?\" \"I presume she will,\" Pauline answered. \"Maybe she'll want to come back with us.\" She knows mother wants her to stay the week\n",
      "out. Listen, Patty--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Patience sat up and took notice. When people Pattied her, it generally\n",
      "meant they had a favor to ask, or something of the sort. \"Remember, you're to be very careful not to let Hilary\n",
      "suspect--anything.\" \"Won't she like it--all, when she does know?\" \"It's like having a fairy godmother,\n",
      "isn't it? John moved to the bedroom. If you'd had three wishes, Paul, wouldn't\n",
      "you've chosen--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'd better begin quieting down, Patience, or Hilary can't help\n",
      "suspecting something.\" \"If she knew--she wouldn't stay a single\n",
      "day longer, would she?\" \"That's one reason why she mustn't know.\" \"When will you tell her; or is mother going to?\" See here, Patience, you may drive--if you won't hi\n",
      "yi.\" \"Please, Paul, let me, when we get to the avenue. It's stupid coming\n",
      "to a place, like Fanny'd gone to sleep.\" \"Not before--and only once then,\" Pauline stipulated, and Patience\n",
      "possessed her soul in at least a faint semblance of patience until they\n",
      "turned into the avenue of maples. Then she suddenly tightened her hold\n",
      "on the reins, bounced excitedly up and down, crying sharply--\"Hi yi!\" Fanny instantly pricked up her ears, and, what was more to the purpose,\n",
      "actually started into what might almost have been called a trot. Patience said proudly, as they turned into the yard. \"I heard Impatience urging her\n",
      "Rosinante on,\" she laughed. \"Why didn't you let her drive all the way,\n",
      "Paul? \"We've been pretty nearly since dinner getting here, it seems to me,\"\n",
      "Patience declared. \"We had to wait for Paul to write a letter first\n",
      "to--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you alone?\" Pauline broke in hurriedly, asking the first question\n",
      "that came into her mind. Boyd's asleep in the\n",
      "sitting-room, and Mrs. Boyd's taking a nap up-stairs in her own room.\" \"_Have_ you brought me something to read? I've finished both the books\n",
      "I brought with me, and gone through a lot of magazines--queer old\n",
      "things, that Mrs. \"Then you've done very wrong,\" Pauline told her severely, leading Fanny\n",
      "over to a shady spot at one side of the yard and tying her to the\n",
      "fence--a quite unnecessary act, as nothing would have induced Fanny to\n",
      "take her departure unsolicited. Pauline came back, carrying a small paper-covered parcel. Hilary cried, taking it eagerly and sitting down on the steps. Even more than her Where is Mary?  Answer with a single word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "confidence of the French Canadians by presiding at their\n",
      "entertainments, by attending the distribution of prizes at their\n",
      "seminaries, and by giving balls on their feast days. He entertained\n",

      "was irreconcilable. 'By a wrong-headed and melancholy alchemy,' wrote\n",

      "extent; and his disordered moral palate, beneath the blandest smile and\n",
      "the {50} softest language, will turn your Burgundy into vinegar.' The speech with which Lord Gosford opened the session of the\n",
      "legislature in the autumn of 1835 was in line with the rest of his\n",
      "policy. He announced his determination to effect the redress of every\n",
      "grievance. John moved to the hallway. In some cases the action of the executive government would\n",
      "be sufficient to supply the remedy. In others the assistance of the\n",
      "legislature would be necessary. A third class of cases would call for\n",
      "the sanction of the British parliament. He promised that no\n",
      "discrimination against French Canadians should be made in appointments\n",
      "to office. He expressed the opinion that executive councillors should\n",
      "not sit in the legislature. He announced that the French would be\n",
      "guaranteed the use of their native tongue. John journeyed to the kitchen. He made an earnest plea for\n",
      "the settlement of the financial difficulty, and offered some\n",
      "concessions. The legislature should be given\n",
      "------------\n",
      " control of the hereditary\n",
      "revenues of the Crown, if provision were made for the support of the\n",
      "executive and the judiciary. Finally, he made a plea for the\n",
      "reconciliation of the French and English races in the country, whom he\n",
      "described as 'the offspring of the two foremost nations {51} of\n",
      "mankind.' Not even the most extreme of the _Patriotes_ could fail to\n",
      "see that Lord Gosford was holding out to them an olive branch. Sandra travelled to the garden. Great dissatisfaction, of course, arose among the English in the colony\n",
      "at Lord Gosford's policy. 'Constitutional associations,' which had\n",
      "been formed in Quebec and Montreal for the defence of the constitution\n",
      "and the rights and privileges of the English-speaking inhabitants of\n",
      "Canada, expressed gloomy forebodings as to the probable result of the\n",
      "policy. The British in Montreal organized among themselves a volunteer\n",
      "rifle corps, eight hundred strong, 'to protect their persons and\n",
      "property, and to assist in maintaining the rights and principles\n",
      "granted them by the constitution'; and there was much indignation when\n",
      "the rifle corps was forced to disband by order of the governor, who\n",
      "declared that the constitution was in no danger, and that, even if it\n",
      "were, the government would be competent to deal with the situation. Nor did Gosford find it plain sailing with all the French Canadians. Papineau's followers in the House took up at first a distinctly\n",
      "independent attitude. Gosford was informed {52} that the appointment\n",
      "of the royal commission was an insult to the Assembly; it threw doubt\n",
      "on the assertions which Papineau and his followers had made in\n",
      "petitions and resolutions. When these sticks are\n",

      "men, they are to be joined at that time by the simple, secure, and\n",
      "momentary operation just mentioned. The Rockets are carried in a sort of saddle bags, as they may be\n",
      "termed, stitched into separate compartments for each Rocket, covered\n",
      "by a flap at one end, and secured by a chain, staples, and padlocks,\n",
      "the Rocket lying horizontally. By this arrangement the load lies in the\n",
      "most compact form possible, and close to the horse’s side, while the\n",
      "Rockets, being thus separated, cannot be injured by carriage. The load is divided into three parts, the case or bundle of eighteen\n",
      "sticks, and a separate saddle bag on each side, contrived to hook on to\n",
      "the saddle, carrying nine Rockets in each bag. By this means there is\n",
      "no difficulty in loading and unloading the horse. The whole weight thus carried by an Ammunition Horse is about 19 stone,\n",
      "consisting of about 6½ stone for the saddle, sticks, &c. and almost\n",
      "six stone in each of the saddle bags. From which it is evident, that\n",
      "there is no fear of the load swagging the horse in travelling, because\n",
      "the centre of gravity is very considerably below his back bone. It is\n",
      "evident also, that as the weight of the Rockets diminishes by supplying\n",
      "the mounted men, the weight of the sticks also is diminished, and the\n",
      "centre of gravity may, if desired, be brought lower and lower, as\n",
      "the load diminishes, by taking the ammunition from the upper tiers\n",
      "gradually and equally on each side downwards. It is further evident,\n",
      "that although spaces are provided for nine Rockets in each bag, that\n",
      "number may be diminished, should the difficulty of the country, or the\n",
      "length of the march, or other circumstances, render it advisable to\n",

      "there remains, then, only for No. 1 to touch the vent of the Rocket\n",
      "with his portfire, No. 3 having run back for another round, which No. 2 will have been able to prepare in the mean time. In this way the\n",
      "sub-division will, without hurry, come into action with six bouches a\n",
      "feù, in one minute’s time, and may continue their fire, without any\n",
      "extraordinary exertion, at the rate of from two to three rounds from\n",
      "each chamber in a minute, or even four with good exertion; so that the\n",
      "six bouches a feù would discharge 80 rounds of 6-pounder ammunition in\n",
      "three minutes. Twelve light frames for firing the 12-pounder Rockets at\n",
      "high angles are further provided in addition to the ground chambers,\n",
      "and each of the drivers of the ammunition horses has one in his charge,\n",
      "in case of distant action. The preparation of the Rocket for firing is merely the fixing the stick\n",
      "to it, either by the pincers, pointed hammer, or wrench, provided for\n",
      "joining the parts of the stick also. These modes I have lately devised,\n",
      "as being more simple and economical than the screw formerly used; but\n",
      "cannot at present pronounce which is the best; great care, however,\n",

      "so, the Rocket is liable to burst; and in firing the portfire must not\n",
      "be thrust too far into the Rocket, for the same reason. On the words “_Cease firing_,” No. 1 cuts his portfire, takes up\n",
      "his chamber, runs back to his section, and replaces the chamber\n",
      "immediately. 3 also immediately runs back; and having no other\n",

      "may be ordered, in less than a minute from the word “_Cease firing_”\n",
      "having been given. It is obvious that the combined celerity and quantity of the discharge\n",
      "of ammunition of this description of artillery cannot be equalled or\n",
      "even approached, taking in view the means and nature of ammunition\n",
      "employed, by any other known system; the universality also of the\n",
      "operation, not being incumbered with wheel carriages, must be duly\n",

      "experienced person ought to be trained for the supervision of this work\n",
      "in addition to the sergeant Harmen Claasz, who has done this work for\n",
      "the last 25 years, and has gained much experience during his residence\n",
      "in the forests of the Wanni, and knows exactly when the timber ought\n",
      "to be felled, when it can be transported, and what kinds of trees are\n",
      "the most suitable. Because it must be remembered that like all human\n",
      "beings he also is only mortal. I therefore some time ago appointed the\n",
      "soldier Laurens Hendriksz as his assistant. He is still employed in\n",
      "the same capacity. As these forests are very malarious, there are but\n",
      "few Dutchmen who could live there, and this is the more reason why Your\n",
      "Honours should always see that an able person is trained to the work,\n",
      "so as to avoid inconvenience some time or other. It is impossible to\n",
      "employ a native in this work, because the Wannias would not have the\n",
      "same regard for a native as for a European, and one of their caprices\n",
      "to which they are so often subject might interfere with the work. [23]\n",
      "\n",
      "Charcoal, made from the kernel of the palmyra fruit, is used here\n",
      "for the smith's forge. In the Memoir referred to Your Honours will\n",
      "also find stated by whom this is furnished to the Company. As I\n",
      "noticed that the work in the smith's forge had to be discontinued\n",
      "sometimes for want of charcoal, especially during the months of\n",
      "August, September, and October, which causes great inconvenience to\n",
      "the Government, I proposed to His Excellency the Governor and Council\n",
      "that a quantity of smiths' coals from Holland should be provided. It must be used in times of scarcity, and the\n",
      "people who are bound to collect and burn the kernel must be kept\n",
      "to their duty, and compelled to deliver up the full extent of their\n",
      "tax. The coals from Holland must be looked upon as a reserve supply,\n",
      "to be used only when no pannangay kernels are to be had, as happens\n",
      "sometimes when the inhabitants plant these seeds in order to obtain\n",
      "from them a kind of root, called calengen, which they use as food. [24]\n",
      "\n",
      "Bark-lunt is another article which the Company receives from the\n",
      "inhabitants here without any expense. All inhabitants who go yearly\n",
      "to the Wanni to sow and mow, consisting of about 6,000 or 7,000\n",
      "and sometimes even 10,000 persons, and who pay 10 of these lunts to\n",
      "the Wannias, have on their return at the Passes to pay a piece of\n",
      "lunt each, 4 fathoms long, and for each cow or bull they have with\n",
      "them and have employed in the Wanni for ploughing or have allowed\n",
      "to graze there they also have to pay the same. Sandra moved to the hallway. This amounts to a\n",
      "considerable quantity yearly, nearly 60,000 lunts. It is a matter\n",
      "of little importance, but a great convenience, because not only the\n",
      "garrison in this Commandement is thus furnished, but a large quantity\n",
      "may also be sent to other places when required, as is done usually to\n",
      "Negapatam and Trincomalee, for which a charge of 1 stiver a piece is\n",
      "made, which\n",
      "------------\n",
      " amount is entered here with the general income and charged\n",
      "to the said stations. Care must be taken that this duty is paid at\n",
      "the Redoubts, but on the other hand also that not too much is charged\n",
      "to these people, because I have heard complaints that sometimes more\n",
      "than 4 fathoms of the lunt is demanded. This is unfair, because the\n",
      "surplus is appropriated by persons who have no right to it. [25]\n",
      "\n",
      "Coral stone, used for building purposes and for the burning of lime,\n",
      "is found here in abundance. Daniel went to the office. Sandra travelled to the kitchen. This also the Company obtains without any\n",
      "expenditure, because it is dug up and broken by ordinary Oeliares. It\n",
      "is also found at Point Pedro, where it is burnt into lime or otherwise\n",
      "sent to the Castle in tonys or pontoons, where it is then either burnt\n",
      "into lime, used for foundations or for the filling up of the body of\n",
      "walls, which are then covered on the outside with cut coral stone,\n",
      "as this makes them strong and durable. For some years the cut stone\n",
      "has also been sent to Negapatam for the fortifications. This must be\n",
      "continued until we receive notice that it is no longer necessary,\n",
      "which I think will be soon, because I noticed that lately not so\n",
      "much stone was asked for. From 1687 up to the present about 52,950\n",
      "cut stones have been sent to this place. [26]\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be understood from the above that lime is easily obtained here,\n",
      "and without great expenditure. That which is required for the Company\n",
      "here is delivered free of charge. For the lime sent to Negapatam 7\n",
      "fanams are paid in place of 5 light stivers. [37] This is paid to the\n",
      "lime burners at Canganture, who received an advance on this account,\n",
      "of which a small balance is left. Meanwhile the Dessave de Bitter\n",
      "informed us on his return from Coromandel that no more lime was\n",
      "required there, but in order that the Company may not lose by the\n",
      "advance made, a quantity of 8,000 or 9,000 parras of lime is lying\n",
      "ready at Canganture, which must be fetched by the Company's vessels\n",
      "in March or April and brought to Kayts. This, I think, will make up\n",
      "the amount, and if not, they must reimburse the difference. It will\n",
      "be seen from this that we have tried to comply with the wishes of\n",
      "His late Excellency van Mydregt, who wrote from Negapatam on July 10,\n",
      "1687, that the new fortifications there were to be supplied with lime\n",
      "and all other building materials which are to be found here. The lime\n",
      "sent there since that date has amounted to 4,751 31/75 lasts. [27]\n",

      "The dye-root is a product found in this territory which yields the\n",
      "Company a considerable profit. The best kinds are found in Carrediva,\n",
      "but the largest quantity in Manaar. The other kinds, found in the\n",
      "Wanni and The Islands, are so inferior that they cannot be used for\n",
      "dyeing unless they are mixed with the kinds obtained from Manaar\n",
      "and Carrediva, and are found in small quantities only. The inferior\n",
      "kinds are used in this way so that they may not be lost, because it\n",
      "is to be feared that there will be a greater scarcity of root than\n",
      "of cloth. John moved to the office. I will not enter into detail here as to how, by whom,\n",
      "where, and when these roots are dug out, or how they are employed\n",
      "in the dyeing of cloth, or again how much is received yearly; as\n",
      "all these matters have been mentioned at length on other occasions,\n",
      "making it unnecessary to do so here. I therefore refer Your Honours\n",
      "to an account by the late Commandeur Blom, dated April 25, 1693,\n",

      "that Kate Kenyon suspected Wade Miller of having a hand in our capture,\n",
      "and told Muriel that we had been carried off by him, for I fancy that is\n",
      "exactly what happened. Muriel was angry with Miller, and he seized the\n",

      "made such a hustle to save us.\" \"Thin we should be thankful thot Muriel an' Miller do not love ache\n",

      "fell to examining the room in which they were imprisoned. It did not\n",
      "seem to have a window anywhere, and the single door appeared to be the\n",
      "only means of entering or leaving the place. \"There's little show of escaping from this room,\" said Frank. \"This wur built to kape iverything safe\n",
      "thot came in here.\" A few minutes later there was a sound at the door, and Muriel came in,\n",
      "with two of the Black Caps at his heels. \"Ther boys have agreed ter give ye ther chance o' ther cards,\" said the\n",
      "boy moonshiner. \"An' yo're goin' ter have a fair an' squar' deal.\" \"We will have to submit,\" said Frank, quietly. \"You will have ter let ther boys bind yer hands afore ye leave this\n",

      "submit to the inconvenience of having their hands bound behind them. Barney protested, but Frank kept silent, knowing it was useless to say\n",
      "anything. When their hands were tied, Muriel said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Follow.\" He led the way, while Frank came next, with Barney shuffling sulkily\n",
      "along at his heels. They passed through a dark room and entered another room, which was\n",
      "lighted by three oil lamps. The room was well filled with the\n",
      "black-hooded moonshiners, who were standing in a grim and silent\n",
      "circle, with their backs against the walls. Into the center of this circle, the boys were marched. The door closed,\n",
      "and Muriel addressed the Black Caps. Sandra travelled to the bathroom. \"It is not often that we-uns gives our captives ther choice uv ther\n",
      "cards or ther vote, but we have agreed ter do so in this case, with only\n",
      "one objectin', an' he war induced ter change his mind. Now we mean ter\n",
      "have this fair an' squar', an' I call on ev'ry man present ter watch out\n",
      "an' see that it is. Ther men has been serlected, one ter hold ther cards\n",
      "an' one ter draw. Two of the Black Caps stepped out, and Frank started a bit, for he\n",
      "believed one of them was Wade Miller. A pack of cards was produced, and Muriel shuffled them with a skill that\n",
      "told of experience, after which he handed them to one of the men. Frank watched every move, determined to detect the fraud if possible,\n",
      "should there be any fraud. An awed hush seemed to settle over the room. The men who wore the black hoods leaned forward a little, every one of\n",
      "them watching to see what card should be drawn from the pack. Barney Mulloy caught his breath with a gasping sound, and then was\n",
      "silent, standing stiff and straight. Muriel was as alert as a panther, and his eyes gleamed through the holes\n",
      "in his mask like twin stars. The man who received the pack from Muriel stepped forward, and Miller\n",
      "reached out his hand to draw. Then Frank suddenly cried:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait! That we may be satisfied we are having a fair show in this\n",
      "matter, why not permit one of us to shuffle those cards?\" Quick as a flash of light, Muriel's hand fell on the wrist of the man\n",
      "who held the cards, and his clear voice rang out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stop! Frank's hands were unbound, and he was given the cards. He shuffled\n",
      "them, but he did not handle them with more skill than had Muriel. He\n",
      "\"shook them up\" thoroughly, and then passed them back to the man who\n",
      "was to hold them. Muriel's order was swiftly obeyed, and Frank was again helpless. Wade Miller reached out, and quickly made the\n",
      "draw, holding the fateful card up for all to see. From beneath the black hoods sounded the terrible word, as the man\n",
      "beheld the black card which was exposed to view. Frank's heart dropped like a stone into the depths of his bosom, but no\n",
      "sound came from his lips. Barney\n",
      "------------\n",
      " Mulloy showed an equal amount of nerve. Indeed, the Irish lad\n",
      "laughed recklessly as he cried:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's nivver a show we had at all, at all, Frankie. Th' snakes had it\n",
      "fixed fer us all th' toime.\" The words came from Muriel, and the boy chief of the moonshiners made a\n",
      "spring and a grab, snatching the card from Miller's hand. Let's give ther critters a fair\n",
      "show.\" \"Do you mean ter say they didn't have a fair show?\" \"Not knowin' it,\" answered Muriel. \"But ther draw warn't fair, jes' ther\n",
      "same.\" One is ther ace o' spades, an' ther other is ther\n",
      "nine o' hearts.\" Exclamations of astonishment came from all sides, and a ray of hope shot\n",
      "into Frank Merriwell's heart. Ther black card war ther one exposed, an' that settles what'll be\n",
      "done with ther spies.\" \"Them boys is goin' ter\n",
      "have a squar' show.\" It was with the greatest difficulty that Miller held himself in check. His hands were clinched, and Frank fancied that he longed to spring upon\n",
      "Muriel. The boy chief was very cool as he took the pack of cards from the hand\n",
      "of the man who had held them. \"Release one of the prisoners,\" was his command. \"The cards shall be\n",
      "shuffled again.\" Once more Frank's hands were freed, and again the cards were given him\n",
      "to shuffle. He mixed them deftly, without saying a word, and gave them\n",
      "back to Muriel. Then his hands were tied, and he awaited the second\n",
      "drawing. \"Be careful an' not get two cards this time,\" warned Muriel as he faced\n",
      "Miller. \"This draw settles ther business fer them-uns.\" The cards were given to the man who was to hold them, and Miller stepped\n",
      "forward to draw. Again the suspense became great, again the men leaned forward to see the\n",
      "card that should be pulled from the pack; again the hearts of the\n",
      "captives stood still. He seemed to feel that the tide had turned against\n",
      "him. For a moment he was tempted to refuse to draw, and then, with a\n",
      "muttered exclamation, he pulled a card from the pack and held it up to\n",
      "view. Then, with a bitter cry of baffled rage, he flung it madly to the\n",
      "floor. Each man in the room seemed to draw a deep breath. It was plain that\n",
      "some were disappointed, and some were well satisfied. \"They-uns won't be put out o'\n",
      "ther way ter-night.\" \"An' I claim that it don't,\" returned the youthful moonshiner, without\n",
      "lifting his voice in the least. \"You-uns all agreed ter ther second\n",
      "draw, an' that lets them off.\" \"But\n",
      "them critters ain't out o' ther maountings yit!\" \"By that yer mean--jes' what?\" \"They're not liable ter git out alive.\" \"Ef they-uns is killed, I'll know whar ter look fer ther one as war at\n",
      "ther bottom o' ther job--an' I'll look!\" Muriel did not bluster, and he did not speak above an ordinary tone, but\n",
      "it was plain that he meant every word. \"Wal,\" muttered Miller, \"what do ye mean ter do with them critters--turn\n",
      "'em out, an' let 'em bring ther officers down on us?\" I'm goin' ter keep 'em till they kin be escorted out o' ther\n",
      "maountings. Thar ain't time ter-night, fer it's gittin' toward mornin'. Ter-morrer night it can be done.\" He seemed to know it was useless to make further\n",
      "talk, but Frank and Barney knew that they were not yet out of danger. The boys seemed as cool as any one in the room, for all of the deadly\n",

      "room whar ye war a bit ago.\" They were willing to go back, and it was with no small amount of relief\n",
      "that they allowed themselves to be escorted to the apartment. Muriel dismissed the two guards, and then he set the hands of the boys\n",
      "free. \"Suspecting you of double-dealing.\" It seemed that you had saved us from being\n",

      "The earliest inhabitants of Rome were an Aryan or, as they used to be\n",
      "called, Indo-Germanic race, who established themselves in a country\n",
      "previously occupied by Pelasgians. Their principal neighbour on one side\n",
      "was Etruria, a Pelasgian nation. On the other hand was Magna Græcia,\n",
      "which had been colonised in very early ages by Hellenic settlers of\n",
      "kindred origin. It was therefore impossible that the architecture of the\n",
      "Romans should not be in fact a mixture of the styles of these two\n",
      "people. As a transition order, it was only a mechanical juxtaposition of\n",
      "both styles, the real fusion taking place many long centuries\n",
      "afterwards. Throughout the Roman period the two styles remain distinct,\n",
      "and there is no great difficulty in referring almost every feature in\n",
      "Roman architecture to its origin. From the Greeks were borrowed the rectangular peristylar temple, with\n",
      "its columns and horizontal architraves, though they seldom if ever used\n",
      "it in its perfect purity, the cella of the Greek temples not being\n",
      "sufficiently large for their purposes. The principal Etruscan temples,\n",
      "as we have already shown, were square in plan, and the inner half\n",
      "occupied by one or more cells, to the sides and back of which the\n",
      "portico never extended. The Roman rectangular temple is a mixture of\n",
      "these two: it is generally, like the Greek examples, longer than its\n",
      "breadth, but the colonnade never seems to have entirely surrounded the\n",
      "building. Sometimes it extends to the two sides as well as the front,\n",
      "but more generally the cella occupies the whole of the inner part though\n",
      "frequently ornamented by a false peristyle of three-quarter columns\n",
      "attached to its walls. Besides this, the Romans borrowed from the Etruscans or Greeks a\n",
      "circular form of temple. As applied by the Romans it was generally\n",
      "encircled by a peristyle of columns, though it is not clear that the\n",
      "Etruscans so used it; this may therefore be an improvement adopted from\n",
      "the Greeks on an Etruscan form. In early times these circular temples\n",
      "were dedicated to Vesta, Cybele, or some god or goddess either unknown\n",
      "or not generally worshipped by the Aryan races; but in later times this\n",
      "distinction was lost sight of. A more important characteristic which the Romans borrowed from the\n",
      "Etruscans was the circular arch. It was known, it is true, to the\n",
      "Egyptians, Assyrians, and Greeks; yet none of these people, perhaps\n",
      "excepting the Assyrians, seem to have used it as a feature in their\n",
      "ornamental architecture; but the Etruscans appear to have had a peculiar\n",
      "predilection for it, and from them the Romans adopted it boldly, and\n",
      "introduced it into almost all their buildings. It was not at first used\n",
      "in temples of Grecian form, nor even in their peristylar circular ones. In the civil buildings of the Romans it was a universal feature, but was\n",
      "generally placed in juxtaposition with the Grecian orders. In the\n",
      "Colosseum, for instance, the whole construction is arched; but a useless\n",
      "network of ill-designed and ill-arranged Grecian columns, with their\n",
      "entablatures, is spread over the whole. This is a curious instance of\n",
      "the mixture of the two styles, and as such is very characteristic of\n",
      "Roman art; but in an artistic point of view the place of these columns\n",
      "would have been far better supplied by buttresses or panels, or some\n",
      "expedient more correctly constructive. After having thoroughly familiarised themselves with the forms of the\n",
      "arch as an architectural feature, the Romans made a bold stride in\n",
      "advance by\n",
      "------------\n",
      " applying it as a vault both to the circular and rectangular\n",
      "forms of buildings. The most perfect examples of this are the rotunda of\n",
      "the Pantheon and the basilica of Maxentius, commonly called the Temple\n",
      "of Peace, strangely like each other in conception, though apparently so\n",
      "distant in date. In these buildings the Roman architects so completely\n",
      "emancipated themselves from the trammels of former styles as almost to\n",
      "entitle them to claim the invention of a new order of architecture. It\n",
      "would have required some more practice to invent details appropriate to\n",
      "the purpose; still these two buildings are to this hour unsurpassed for\n",
      "boldness of conception and just appreciation of the manner in which the\n",
      "new method ought to be applied. This is almost universally acknowledged\n",
      "so far as the interior of the Pantheon is concerned. In simple grandeur\n",
      "it is as yet unequalled; its faults being principally those of detail. John journeyed to the hallway. It is not so easy, however, to form an opinion of the Temple of Peace in\n",
      "its present ruined state; but in so far as we can judge from what yet\n",
      "remains of it, in boldness and majesty of conception it must have been\n",
      "quite equal to the other example, though it must have required far more\n",
      "familiarity with the style adopted to manage its design as appropriately\n",
      "as the simpler dome of the Pantheon. These two buildings may be considered as exemplifying the extent to\n",
      "which the Romans had progressed in the invention of a new style of\n",
      "architecture and the state in which they left it to their successors. It\n",
      "may however be worth while pointing out how, in transplanting Roman\n",
      "architecture to their new capital on the shores of the Bosphorus, the\n",

      "baptisteries, the other in churches, but always kept distinct, as in\n",
      "Rome. In France they were so completely fused into each other that it\n",
      "requires considerable knowledge of architectural analysis to separate\n",
      "them again into their component parts. In England we rejected the\n",

      "when under French influence. Each race reclaimed its own among the\n",
      "spoils of Rome, and used it with the improvements it had acquired during\n",
      "its employment in the Imperial city. The first thing that strikes the student in attempting to classify the\n",
      "numerous examples of Roman architecture is the immense variety of\n",
      "purposes to which it is applied, as compared with previous styles. In\n",
      "Egypt architecture was applied only to temples, palaces and tombs. In\n",
      "Greece it was almost wholly confined to temples and theatres; and in\n",
      "Etruria to tombs. It is in Rome that we first feel that we have not to\n",
      "deal with either a Theocracy or a kingdom, but with a great people, who\n",
      "for the first time in the world’s history rendered architecture\n",
      "subservient to the myriad wants of the many-headed monster. It thus\n",
      "happens that in the Roman cities, in addition to temples we find\n",
      "basilicas, theatres and amphitheatres, baths, palaces, tombs, arches of\n",
      "triumph and pillars of victory, gates, bridges, and aqueducts, all\n",
      "equally objects of architectural skill. The best of these, in fact, are\n",
      "those which from previous neglect in other countries are here stamped\n",
      "with originality. These would have been noble works indeed had it not\n",
      "been that the Romans unsuccessfully applied to them those orders and\n",
      "details of architecture which were intended only to be applied to\n",
      "temples by other nations. In the time of Constantine these orders had\n",
      "nearly died out, and were only subordinately used for decorative\n",
      "purposes. In a little while they would have died out altogether, and the\n",
      "Roman would have become a new and complete style; but, as before\n",
      "remarked, this did not take place, and the most ancient orders therefore\n",
      "still remain an essential part of Roman art. We find the old orders\n",
      "predominating in the age of Augustus, and see them gradually die out as\n",
      "we approach that of Constantine. Adopting the usual classification, the first of the Roman orders is the\n",
      "Doric, which, like everything else in this style, takes a place about\n",
      "half-way between the Tuscan wooden posts and the nobly\n",
      "------------\n",
      " simple order of\n",
      "the Greeks. It no doubt was a great improvement on the former, but for\n",
      "monumental purposes infinitely inferior to the latter. It was, however,\n",
      "more manageable; and for forums or courtyards, or as a three-quarter\n",
      "column between arcades, it was better adapted than the severer Greek\n",
      "style, which, when so employed, not only loses almost all its beauty,\n",
      "but becomes more unmeaning than the Roman. This fact was apparently\n",
      "recognised; for there is not, so far as is known, a single Doric temple\n",
      "throughout the Roman world. It would in consequence be most unfair to\n",
      "institute a comparison between a mere utilitarian prop used only in\n",
      "civil buildings and an order which the most refined artists in the world\n",
      "spent all their ingenuity in rendering the most perfect, because it was\n",
      "devoted to the highest religious purposes. The addition of an independent base made the order much more generally\n",
      "useful, and its adoption brought it much more into harmony with the\n",
      "other two existing orders, which would appear to have been the principal\n",
      "object of its introduction. The keynote of Roman architecture was the\n",
      "Corinthian order; and as, from the necessities of their tall,\n",
      "many-storeyed buildings, the Romans were forced to use the three orders\n",
      "together, often one over the other, it was indispensable that the three\n",
      "should be reduced to something like harmony. This was accordingly done,\n",
      "but at the expense of the Doric order, which, except when thus used in\n",
      "combination, must be confessed to have very little claim to our\n",
      "admiration. The Romans were much more unfortunate in their modifications of the\n",
      "Ionic order than in those which they introduced into the Doric. They\n",
      "never seem to have either liked or understood it, nor to have employed\n",
      "it except as a _mezzo termine_ between the other two. In its own native\n",
      "East this order had originally only been used in porticoes between piers\n",
      "or _antæ_, where of course only one face was shown, and there were no\n",
      "angles to be turned. When the Greeks adopted it they used it in temples\n",
      "of Doric form, and in consequence were obliged to introduce a capital at\n",
      "each angle, with two voluted faces in juxtaposition at right angles to\n",
      "one another. In some instances—internally at least—as at Bassæ (Woodcut\n",
      "No. 142) they used a capital with four faces. The Romans, impatient of\n",
      "control, eagerly seized on this modification, but never quite got over\n",
      "the extreme difficulty of its employment. With them the angular volutes\n",
      "became mere horns, and even in the best examples the capital wants\n",
      "harmony and meaning. When used as a three-quarter column these alterations were not required,\n",
      "and then the order resembled more its original form; but even in this\n",
      "state it was never equal to the Greek examples, and gradually\n",
      "deteriorated to the corrupt application of it in the Temple of Concord\n",
      "in the Forum, which is the most degenerate example of the order now to\n",
      "be found in Roman remains. John journeyed to the bedroom. The fate of this order in the hands of the Romans was different from\n",
      "that of the other two. The Doric and Ionic orders had reached their acme\n",
      "of perfection in the hands of the Grecian artists, and seem to have\n",
      "become incapable of further improvement. The prominent building is the\n",

      "experiences in the days of border wars and through the Civil War are\n",

      "how the almost simultaneous death of two or three beloved children, whom\n",
      "all his medical learning and that of other doctors he had summoned had\n",
      "been powerless to save, had caused him to renounce forever the belief that\n",
      "drugs could cure disease. He believed Nature had a true system, and for\n",
      "this he began a patient search. He wandered here and there, almost in the\n",
      "condition of the religious reformers of old, who \"wandered up and down\n",
      "clad in sheep-skins and goat-hides, of whom the world was not worthy.\" In\n",
      "the name of suffering humanity he desecrated the grave of poor Lo, that he\n",
      "might read from his red bones some clue to the secret. Sandra travelled to the bathroom. One Osteopathic journal claims to tell authentically how Still was led to\n",
      "the discovery of the \"great truth.\" Sandra travelled to the bedroom. It states that by accidentally curing\n",
      "a case of asthma by \"fooling with the bones of the chest,\" he was led to\n",
      "the belief that bones out of normal position cause disease. Still himself tells a rather different story in a popular magazine posing\n",
      "of late years as a public educator in matters of therapeutics. In this\n",
      "magazine Still tells how he discovered the principles of Osteopathy by\n",
      "curing a terrible headache resting the back of his neck across a swing\n",
      "made of his father's plowlines, and next by writhing on his back across a\n",
      "log to relieve the pain of dysentery. Accidentally the \"lesion\" was\n",
      "corrected, or the proper center \"inhibited,\" and his headache and flux\n",
      "immediately cured. You can take your choice of these various versions of the wonderful\n",
      "discovery. Ever since Osteopathy began to attract attention, and people began to\n",
      "inquire \"What is it?\" its leading promoters have vied with each other in\n",
      "trying to construct a good definition for their \"great new science.\" Here are some of the definitions:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Osteopathy is the science of drugless healing.\" For a genuine \"lesion\"\n",
      "Osteopath that would not do at all. It is too broad and gives too much\n",
      "scope to the physicians who would do more than \"pull bones.\" \"Osteopathy is practical anatomy and physiology skillfully and\n",
      "scientifically applied as _manual_ treatment of disease.\" That definition\n",
      "suits better, because of the \"manual treatment.\" If you are a true\n",
      "Osteopath you must do it _all_ with your hands. It will not do to use any\n",
      "mechanical appliances, for if you do you cannot keep up the impression\n",
      "that you are \"handling the body with the skilled touch of a master who\n",
      "knows every part of his machine.\" \"The human body is a machine run by the unseen force called life,\n",
      "------------\n",
      " and that\n",
      "it may run harmoniously it is necessary that there be liberty of blood,\n",
      "nerves, and arteries from the generating point to destination.\" This\n",
      "definition may be impressive to the popular mind, but, upon analysis, we\n",
      "wonder if any other string of big words might not have had the same\n",
      "effect. \"Liberty of blood\" is a proposition even a stupid medical man must\n",
      "admit. Of course, there must be free circulation of blood, and massage, or\n",
      "hot and cold applications, or exercise, or anything that will stimulate\n",
      "circulation, is rational. But when \"liberty of blood\" is mentioned, what\n",
      "is meant by \"liberty of arteries\"? \"Osteopathy seeks to obtain perfect skeletal alignment and tonic\n",
      "ligamentous, muscular and facial relaxation.\" Some Osteopaths and other\n",
      "therapeutic reformers (?) have contended that medical men purposely used\n",
      "\"big words\" and Latin names to confound the laity. What must we think of\n",
      "the one just given as a popular definition? A good many Osteopaths are becoming disgusted with the big words,\n",
      "technical terms and \"high-sounding nothings\" used by so many Osteopathic\n",
      "writers. The limit of this was never reached, however, until an A.B.,\n",
      "Ph.D., D.O. wrote an article to elucidate Osteopathy for the general\n",
      "public in an American encyclopedia. It takes scholarly wisdom to simplify\n",
      "great truths and bring them to the comprehension of ordinary minds. If\n",
      "writers for the medical profession want a lesson in the art of simplifying\n",
      "and popularizing therapeutic science, they should study this article on\n",
      "Osteopathy in the encyclopedia. A brief history of Osteopathy is perhaps in place. The following summary\n",
      "is taken from leading Osteopathic journals. As to the personality and\n",
      "motives of its founders I know but little; of the motives of its leading\n",
      "promoters a candid public must be the judge. But judgment should be\n",
      "withheld until all the truth is known. The principles of Osteopathy were discovered by Dr. He was at that time a physician of the old school practicing in\n",
      "Kansas. His father, brothers and uncles were all medical practitioners. He\n",
      "was at one time scout surgeon under General Fremont. During the Civil War\n",
      "he was surgeon in the Union army in a volunteer corps. It was during the\n",
      "war that he began to lose faith in drugs, and to search for something\n",
      "natural in combating disease. Then began a long struggle with poverty and abuse. He was obstructed by\n",
      "his profession and ridiculed by his friends. Fifteen years after the\n",
      "discovery of Osteopathy found Dr. Still located in the little town of\n",
      "Kirksville, Mo., where he had gradually attracted a following who had\n",
      "implicit faith in his power to heal by what to them seemed mysterious\n",
      "movements. His fame spread beyond the town, and chronic sufferers began to turn\n",
      "toward Kirksville as a Mecca of healing. Others began to desire Still's\n",
      "healing powers. In 1892 the American School of Osteopathy was founded,\n",
      "which from a small beginning has grown until the present buildings and\n",
      "equipment cost more than $100,000. Hundreds of students are graduated\n",

      "have boasted of superior equipment for intelligent physicians. Incidentally we pause to make excuse for the expressions: \"Curbing our\n",

      "death knell begins to sound_,\" indicate that Osteopathic leaders are\n",
      "content to trust the future of Osteopathy to its merits? If Osteopathic promoters do not feel that the life of their science\n",
      "depends on boosting, what did the secretary of the A.O.A. mean when he\n",
      "said, \"Upon the success of these efforts depends the weal or woe of\n",

      "have been about the best boosted fad ever fancied by a foolish people. Osteopathic journals have\n",
      "published again and again the nice things a number of governors said when\n",
      "they signed the bills investing Osteopathy with the dignity of State\n",
      "authority. A certain United States senator from Ohio has won more notoriety as a\n",
      "champion of Osteopathy than he has lasting fame as a statesman. Osteopathy has been the especial protege of authors. Mary moved to the bathroom. Mark Twain once went\n",
      "up to Albany and routed an army of medical lobbyists who were there to\n",
      "resist the passage of a bill favorable to Osteopathy. For this heroic deed\n",

      "boldness with which she portrays the passions and emotions of humanity. But they are both better known to Osteopaths for the bouquets they have\n",
      "tossed at Osteopathy than for their profound human philosophy that used to\n",
      "be promulgated by the _Chicago American_. Emerson Hough gave a little free advertising in his \"Heart's Desire.\" There may have been \"method in his madness,\" for that Osteopathic horse\n",
      "doctoring scene no doubt sold many a book for the author. Sam Jones also helped along with some of his striking originality. Sam\n",
      "said, \"There is as much difference between Osteopathy and massage as\n",
      "between playing a piano and currying a horse.\" The idea of comparing the\n",
      "Osteopath's manipulations of the human body to the skilled touch of the\n",
      "pianist upon his instrument was especially pleasing to Osteopaths. However, Sam displayed about the same comprehension of his subject that\n",
      "preachers usually exhibit who try to say nice things about the doctors\n",
      "when they get their doctoring gratis or at reduced rates. These champions of Osteopathy no doubt mean well. They can be excused on\n",
      "the ground that they got out of place to aid in the cause of \"struggling\n",

      "and great influence, who uphold and champion new systems under such\n",
      "conditions that it is questionable whether they do it from principle or\n",

      "see how long this brother would hold his practice if he were an Osteopath\n",

Mary travelled to the office. And she began to remove handfuls of hairpins from the yellow knotted\n",
      "curls. exclaimed Zoie, as she sprayed her white neck and\n",
      "arms with her favourite perfume. Zoie leaned forward toward the mirror to smooth out her eyebrows with\n",
      "the tips of her perfumed fingers. \"Good gracious,\" she cried in horror\n",
      "as she caught sight of her reflection. \"You're not going to put my hair\n",
      "in a pigtail!\" \"That's the way invalids always have their hair,\" was Aggie's laconic\n",
      "reply, and she continued to plait the obstinate curls. declared Zoie, and she shook herself free\n",
      "from Aggie's unwelcome attentions and proceeded to unplait the hateful\n",
      "pigtail. \"If you're going to make a perfect fright of me,\" pouted Zoie, \"I just\n",
      "won't see him.\" \"He isn't coming to see YOU,\" reminded Aggie. \"He's coming to see the\n",
      "baby.\" \"If Jimmy doesn't come soon, I'll not HAVE any baby,\" answered Zoie. \"Get into bed,\" said Aggie, and she proceeded to turn down the soft lace\n",
      "coverlets. Her eyes caught the small knot of\n",
      "lace and ribbons for which she was looking, and she pinned it on top of\n",
      "her saucy little curls. \"In you go,\" said Aggie, motioning to the bed. \"Wait,\" said Zoie impressively, \"wait till I get my rose lights on the\n",
      "pillow.\" She pulled the slender gold chain of her night lamp; instantly\n",
      "the large white pillows were bathed in a warm pink glow--she studied\n",
      "the effect very carefully, then added a lingerie pillow to the two\n",
      "more formal ones, kicked off her slippers and hopped into bed. One more\n",
      "glance at the pillows, then she arranged the ribbons of her negligee to\n",
      "fall \"carelessly\" outside the coverlet, threw one arm gracefully above\n",
      "her head, half-closed her eyes, and sank languidly back against her\n",
      "pillows. Controlling her impulse to smile, Aggie crossed to the dressing-table\n",
      "with a business-like air and applied to Zoie's pink cheeks a third\n",
      "coating of powder. Zoie sat bolt upright and began to sneeze. \"Aggie,\" she said, \"I just\n",
      "hate you when you act like that.\" But suddenly she was seized with a new\n",
      "idea. \"I wonder,\" she mused as she looked across the room at the soft, pink\n",
      "------------\n",
      "\n",
      "sofa bathed in firelight, \"I wonder if I shouldn't look better on that\n",
      "couch under those roses.\" Aggie was very emphatic in her opinion to the contrary. \"Then,\" decided Zoie with a mischievous smile, \"I'll get Alfred to carry\n",
      "me to the couch. That way I can get my arms around his neck. And once\n",
      "you get your arms around a man's neck, you can MANAGE him.\" Aggie looked down at the small person with distinct disapproval. \"Now,\n",
      "don't you make too much fuss over Alfred,\" she continued. Mary travelled to the kitchen. \"YOU'RE the\n",
      "one who's to do the forgiving. What's more,\" she\n",
      "reminded Zoie, \"you're very, very weak.\" But before she had time to\n",
      "instruct Zoie further there was a sharp, quick ring at the outer door. Mary journeyed to the garden. The two women glanced at each other inquiringly. The next instant a\n",
      "man's step was heard in the hallway. John moved to the hallway. \"Lie down,\" commanded Aggie, and Zoie had barely time to fall back\n",
      "limply on the pillows when the excited young husband burst into the\n",
      "room. CHAPTER XVI\n",
      "\n",
      "When Alfred entered Zoie's bedroom he glanced about him in bewilderment. It appeared that he was in an enchanted chamber. Through the dim rose\n",
      "light he could barely perceive his young wife. She was lying white and\n",
      "apparently lifeless on her pillows. He moved cautiously toward the bed,\n",
      "but Aggie raised a warning finger. Afraid to speak, he grasped Aggie's\n",
      "hand and searched her face for reassurance; she nodded toward Zoie,\n",
      "whose eyes were closed. He tiptoed to the bedside, sank on his knees and\n",
      "reverently kissed the small hand that hung limply across the side of the\n",
      "bed. To Alfred's intense surprise, his lips had barely touched Zoie's\n",
      "fingertips when he felt his head seized in a frantic embrace. \"Alfred,\n",
      "Alfred!\" cried Zoie in delight; then she smothered his face with kisses. As she lifted her head to survey her astonished husband, she caught\n",
      "the reproving eye of Aggie. With a weak little sigh, she relaxed her\n",
      "tenacious hold of Alfred, breathed his name very faintly, and sank back,\n",
      "apparently exhausted, upon her pillows. \"It's been too much for her,\" said the terrified young husband, and he\n",
      "glanced toward Aggie in anxiety. \"How pale she looks,\" added Alfred, as he surveyed the white face on the\n",
      "pillows. \"She's so weak, poor dear,\" sympathised Aggie, almost in a whisper. It was then that his attention\n",
      "was for the first time attracted toward the crib. And again Zoie forgot Aggie's warning and\n",
      "sat straight up in bed. He was making\n",
      "determinedly for the crib, his heart beating high with the pride of\n",
      "possession. Throwing back the coverlets of the bassinette, Alfred stared at the\n",
      "empty bed in silence, then he quickly turned to the two anxious women. Zoie's lips opened to answer, but no words came. The look on her face increased his worst\n",
      "fears. \"Don't tell me he's----\" he could not bring himself to utter the\n",
      "word. Mary went to the bedroom. He continued to look helplessly from one woman to the other. Aggie also made an unsuccessful\n",
      "attempt to speak. Then, driven to desperation by the strain of the\n",
      "situation, Zoie declared boldly: \"He's out.\" \"With Jimmy,\" explained Aggie, coming to Zoie's rescue as well as she\n",
      "knew how. \"Just for a breath of air,\" explained Zoie sweetly She had now entirely\n",
      "regained her self-possession. \"Isn't he very young to be out at night?\" \"We told Jimmy that,\" answered Aggie, amazed at the promptness\n",
      "with which each succeeding lie presented itself. \"But you see,\" she\n",
      "continued, \"Jimmy is so crazy about the child that we can't do anything\n",
      "with him.\" \"He always\n",
      "said babies were 'little red worms.'\" \"Not this one,\" answered Zoie sweetly. \"No, indeed,\" chimed in Aggie. \"I'll soon put a stop to that,\"\n",
      "he declared. Again the two women looked at each other inquiringly, then Aggie\n",
      "stammered evasively. \"Oh, j-just downstairs--somewhere.\" \"I'll LOOK j-just downstairs somewhere,\" decided Alfred, and he snatched\n",
      "up his hat and started toward the door. Coming back to her bedside to reassure her, Alfred was caught in a\n",
      "frantic embrace. \"I'll be back in a minute, dear,\" he said, but Zoie\n",
      "clung to him and pleaded desperately.\n",
      "------------\n",
      " \"You aren't going to leave me the very first thing?\" He had no wish to be cruel to Zoie, but the thought of\n",
      "Jimmy out in the street with his baby at this hour of the night was not\n",
      "to be borne. \"Now, dearie,\" she said, \"I\n",
      "wish you'd go get shaved and wash up a bit. I don't wish baby to see you\n",
      "looking so horrid.\" \"Yes, do, Alfred,\" insisted Aggie. \"He's sure to be here in a minute.\" \"My boy won't care HOW his father looks,\" declared Alfred proudly, and\n",
      "Zoie told Aggie afterward that his chest had momentarily expanded three\n",
      "inches. \"But _I_ care,\" persisted Zoie. \"Now, Zoie,\" cautioned Aggie, as she crossed toward the bed with\n",
      "affected solicitude. Zoie was quick to understand the suggested change in her tactics, and\n",
      "again she sank back on her pillows apparently ill and faint. Utterly vanquished by the dire result of his apparently inhuman\n",
      "thoughtlessness, Alfred glanced at Aggie, uncertain as to how to repair\n",
      "the injury. Aggie beckoned to him to come away from the bed. \"Let her have her own way,\" she whispered with a significant glance\n",
      "toward Zoie. Alfred nodded understandingly and put a finger to his lips to signify\n",
      "that he would henceforth speak in hushed tones, then he tiptoed back to\n",
      "the bed and gently stroked the curls from Zoie's troubled forehead. \"There now, dear,\" he whispered, \"lie still and rest and I'll go shave\n",
      "and wash up a bit.\" \"Mind,\" he whispered to Aggie, \"you are to call me the moment my boy\n",
      "comes,\" and then he slipped quietly into the bedroom. No sooner had Alfred crossed the threshold, than Zoie sat up in bed and\n",
      "called in a sharp whisper to Aggie, \"What's keeping them?\" \"I can't imagine,\" answered Aggie, also in whisper. \"If I had Jimmy here,\" declared Zoie vindictively, \"I'd wring his little\n",
      "fat neck,\" and slipping her little pink toes from beneath the covers,\n",
      "she was about to get out of bed, when Aggie, who was facing Alfred's\n",
      "bedroom door, gave her a warning signal. Zoie had barely time to get back beneath the covers, when Alfred\n",
      "re-entered the room in search of his satchel. Aggie found it for him\n",
      "quickly. Alfred glanced solicitously at Zoie's closed eyes. \"I'm so sorry,\" he\n",
      "apologised to Aggie, and again he slipped softly out of the room. Aggie and Zoie drew together for consultation. \"Suppose Jimmy can't get the baby,\" whispered Zoie. And don't be enquiring\n",
      "what can be going on at _the temple of_ the linen-clad Isis; [309] nor\n",
      "do you stand in any fear _whatever_ of the curving theatres. An accomplice in the escapade will receive everlasting honour; and what\n",

      "the object of the expedition, which somebody called the Gordon Relief\n",

      "     \"I altogether decline the imputation that the projected\n",

      "     National honour in extricating the garrisons, etc., from a\n",
      "     position in which our action in Egypt has placed these garrisons. As for myself, I could make good my retreat at any moment, if I\n",
      "     wished. Now realise what would happen if this first relief\n",
      "     expedition was to bolt, and the steamers fell into the hands of\n",

      "     England engaged in extricating garrisons) would be somewhat\n",
      "     hampered. We, the first and second expeditions, are equally\n",
      "     engaged for the honour of England. I came up\n",
      "     to extricate the garrison, and failed. Earle comes up to\n",
      "     extricate garrisons, and I hope succeeds. Earle does not come to\n",
      "     extricate me. The extrication of the garrisons was supposed to\n",
      "     affect our \"National honour.\" If Earle succeeds, the \"National\n",

      "------------\n",
      "\n",
      "     altogether independent of me, who, for failing, incurs its blame. I am not _the rescued lamb_, and I will not be.\" Lord Wolseley, still possessed with the idea that, now that an\n",
      "expedition had been sanctioned, the question of time was not of\n",
      "supreme importance, and that the relieving expedition might be carried\n",
      "out in a deliberate manner, which would be both more effective and\n",
      "less exposed to risk, did not reach Cairo till September, and had only\n",
      "arrived at Wady Halfa on 8th October, when his final instructions\n",
      "reached him in the following form:--\"The primary object of your\n",
      "expedition is to bring away General Gordon and Colonel Stewart, and\n",
      "you are not to advance further south than necessary to attain that\n",
      "object, and when it has been secured, no further offensive operations\n",
      "of any kind are to be undertaken.\" It had,\n",
      "however, determined to leave the garrisons to their fate, despite the\n",
      "National honour being involved, at the very moment that it sanctioned\n",
      "an enormous expenditure to try and save the lives of its\n",
      "long-neglected representatives, Gordon and Colonel Stewart. With\n",
      "extraordinary shrewdness, Gordon detected the hollowness of its\n",
      "purpose, and wrote:--\"I very much doubt what is really going to be the\n",
      "policy of our Government, even now that the Expedition is at Dongola,\"\n",
      "and if they intend ratting out, \"the troops had better not come beyond\n",
      "Berber till the question of what will be done is settled.\" The receipt of Gordon's and Power's despatches of July showed that\n",
      "there were, at the time of their being written, supplies for four\n",
      "months, which would have carried the garrison on till the end of\n",
      "November. As the greater part of that period had expired when these\n",
      "documents reached Lord Wolseley's hands, it was quite impossible to\n",
      "doubt that time had become the most important factor of all in the\n",
      "situation. The chance of being too late would even then have presented\n",
      "itself to a prudent commander, and, above all, to a friend hastening\n",
      "to the rescue of a friend. The news that Colonel Stewart and some\n",
      "other Europeans had been entrapped and murdered near Merowe, which\n",
      "reached the English commander from different sources before Gordon\n",
      "confirmed it in his letters, was also calculated to stimulate, by\n",
      "showing that Gordon was alone, and had single-handed to conduct the\n",
      "defence of a populous city. Hard on the heels of that intelligence\n",
      "came Gordon's letter of 4th November to Lord Wolseley, who received it\n",
      "at Dongola on 14th of the same month. The letter was a long one, but\n",
      "only two passages need be quoted:--\"At Metemmah, waiting your orders,\n",
      "are five steamers with nine guns.\" Did it not occur to anyone how\n",
      "greatly, at the worst stage of the siege, Gordon had thus weakened\n",
      "himself to assist the relieving expedition? Even for that reason there\n",
      "was not a day or an hour to be lost. But the letter contained a worse and more alarming passage:--\"We can\n",
      "hold out forty days with ease; after that it will be difficult.\" Forty\n",
      "days would have meant till 14th December, one month ahead of the day\n",
      "Lord Wolseley received the news, but the message was really more\n",
      "alarming than the form in which it was published, for there is no\n",
      "doubt that the word \"difficult\" is the official rendering of Gordon's,\n",
      "a little indistinctly written, word \"desperate.\" In face of that\n",
      "alarming message, which only stated facts that ought to have been\n",
      "surmised, if not known, it was no longer possible to pursue the\n",
      "leisurely promenade up the Nile, which was timed so as to bring the\n",
      "whole force to Khartoum in the first week of March. Rescue by the most\n",
      "prominent general and swell troops of England at Easter would hardly\n",
      "gratify the commandant and garrison starved into surrender the\n",
      "previous Christmas, and that was the exact relationship between\n",
      "Wolseley's plans and Gordon's necessities. The date at which Gordon's supplies would be exhausted varied not from\n",
      "any miscalculation, but because on two successive occasions he\n",
      "discovered large stores of grain and biscuits, which had been stolen\n",
      "from the public granaries before his arrival. The supplies that would\n",
      "all have disappeared in November were thus eked out, first till the\n",
      "middle of December, and then finally till the end of January, but\n",
      "there is no doubt that they would not have lasted as long as they did\n",
      "if in the last month of the siege he had not given the civil\n",
      "population permission to leave the doomed town. From any and from\n",
      "every point of view, there was not the shadow of\n",
      "------------\n",
      " an excuse for a\n",
      "moment's delay after the receipt of that letter on 14th November. With the British Exchequer at a commander's back, it is easy to\n",
      "organise an expedition on an elaborate scale, and to carry it out with\n",
      "the nicety of perfection, but for the realisation of these ponderous\n",
      "plans there is one thing more necessary, and that is time. I have no\n",
      "doubt if Gordon's letter had said \"granaries full, can hold out till\n",
      "Easter,\" that Lord Wolseley's deliberate march--Cairo, September 27;\n",
      "Wady Halfa, October 8; Dongola, November 14; Korti, December 30;\n",
      "Metemmah any day in February, and Khartoum, March 3, and those were\n",
      "the approximate dates of his grand plan of campaign--would have been\n",
      "fully successful, and held up for admiration as a model of skill. Unfortunately, it would not do for the occasion, as Gordon was on the\n",
      "verge of starvation and in desperate straits when the rescuing force\n",
      "reached Dongola. It is not easy to alter the plan of any campaign, nor\n",
      "to adapt a heavy moving machine to the work suitable for a light one. To feed 10,000 British soldiers on the middle Nile was alone a feat of\n",
      "organisation such as no other country could have attempted, but the\n",
      "effort was exhausting, and left no reserve energy to despatch that\n",
      "quick-moving battalion which could have reached Gordon's steamers\n",
      "early in December, and would have reinforced the Khartoum garrison,\n",
      "just as Havelock and Outram did the Lucknow Residency. Dongola is only 100 miles below Debbeh, where the intelligence\n",
      "officers and a small force were on that 14th November; Ambukol,\n",
      "specially recommended by Gordon as the best starting-point, is less\n",
      "than fifty miles, and Korti, the point selected by Lord Wolseley, is\n",
      "exactly that distance above Debbeh. The Bayuda desert route by the\n",
      "Jakdul Wells to Metemmah is 170 miles. At Metemmah were the five\n",
      "steamers with nine guns to convoy the desperately needed succour to\n",
      "Khartoum. The energy expended on the despatch of 10,000 men up 150\n",
      "miles of river, if concentrated on 1000 men, must have given a\n",
      "speedier result, but, as the affair was managed, the last day of the\n",
      "year 1884 was reached before there was even that small force ready to\n",
      "make a dash across the desert for Metemmah. The excuses made for this, as the result proved, fatal delay of taking\n",
      "six weeks to do what--the forward movement from Dongola to Korti, not\n",
      "of the main force, but of 1000 men--ought to have been done in one\n",
      "week, were the dearth of camels, the imperfect drill of the camel\n",
      "corps, and, it must be added, the exaggerated fear of the Mahdi's\n",
      "power. When it was attempted to quicken the slow forward movement of\n",
      "the unwieldy force confusion ensued, and no greater progress was\n",
      "effected than if things had been left undisturbed. The erratic policy\n",
      "in procuring camels caused them at the critical moment to be not\n",
      "forthcoming in anything approaching the required numbers, and this\n",
      "difficulty was undoubtedly increased by the treachery of Mahmoud\n",
      "Khalifa, who was the chief contractor we employed. Even when the\n",
      "camels were procured, they had to be broken in for regular work, and\n",
      "the men accustomed to the strange drill and mode of locomotion. The\n",
      "last reason perhaps had the most weight of all, for although the Mahdi\n",
      "with all his hordes had been kept at bay by Gordon single-handed, Lord\n",
      "Wolseley would risk nothing in the field. Probably the determining\n",
      "reason for that decision was that the success of a small force would\n",
      "have revealed how absolutely unnecessary his large and costly\n",
      "expedition was. Yet events were to show beyond possibility of\n",

      "Stewart, an officer of a gallant disposition, who was above all others\n",
      "impressed with the necessity of making an immediate advance, with the\n",
      "view of throwing some help into Khartoum. Unfortunately he was\n",
      "trammelled by his instructions, which were to this effect--he was to\n",
      "establish a fort at Jakdul; but if he found an insufficiency of water\n",
      "there he was at liberty to press on to Metemmah. His action was to be\n",
      "determined by the measure of his own necessities, not of Gordon's, and\n",
      "so Lord Wolseley arranged throughout. He reached that place with his\n",
      "1100 fighting men, but on examining the wells and finding them full,\n",
      "he felt bound to obey the orders of his commander, viz. to establish\n",
      "the fort, and then return to Korti for a reinforcement. It was a case\n",
      "when Nelson's blind eye might have been called into requisition, but\n",
      "even the most gallant officers are not Nelsons. The first advance of General Stewart to Jakdul, reached on 3rd January\n",
      "1885, was in every respect a success. It was achieved without loss,\n",
      "unopposed, and was quite of the nature of a surprise. The British\n",
      "relieving force was at last, after many months' report, proved to be\n",
      "a reality, and although late, it was not too late. If General Stewart\n",
      "had not been tied by his instructions, but left a free hand, he would\n",
      "undoubtedly have pressed on, and a reinforcement of British troops\n",
      "would have entered Khartoum even before the fall of Omdurman. But it\n",
      "must be recorded also that Sir Herbert Stewart was not inspired by the\n",
      "required flash of genius. He paid more deference to the orders of Lord\n",
      "Wolseley than to the grave peril of General Gordon. Sandra went back to the bathroom. \"Saw her!--the world is crazy, or I am--saw her swallow a powder! How\n",
      "could you see her do that or anything else? Hasn't she been shut up in\n",
      "this room for twenty-four hours?\" \"Yes; but with a window like that in the roof, it isn't so very\n",
      "difficult to see into the room, madam.\" \"Oh,\" she cried, shrinking, \"I have a spy in the house, have I? But I\n",

      "you saw her take? You think she has poisoned herself, and that I had a\n",
      "hand in it!\" \"No,\" I hastened to remark, \"he does not think you had a hand in it. He\n",
      "says he saw the girl herself swallow something which he believes to have\n",
      "been the occasion of her death, and only asks you now where she obtained\n",
      "it.\" I never gave her anything; didn't know she had\n",
      "anything.\" Somehow, I believed her, and so felt unwilling to prolong the present\n",
      "interview, especially as each moment delayed the action which I felt it\n",
      "incumbent upon us to take. So, motioning Q to depart upon his errand, I\n",
      "took Mrs. Belden by the hand and endeavored to lead her from the\n",

      "place, and here I will stay,\" while Q, obdurate for the first time,\n",
      "stood staring severely upon us both, and would not move, though I urged\n",
      "him again to make haste, saying that the morning was slipping away, and\n",
      "that the telegram to Mr. \"Till that woman leaves the room, I don't; and unless you promise to\n",
      "take my place in watching her, I don't quit the house.\" Astonished, I left her side and crossed to him. \"You carry your suspicions too far,\" I whispered, \"and I think you are\n",
      "too rude. We have seen nothing, I am sure, to warrant us in any such\n",
      "action; besides, she can do no harm here; though, as for watching her, I\n",
      "promise to do that much if it will relieve your mind.\" \"I don't want her watched here; take her below. \"Are you not assuming a trifle the master?\" If I am, it is because I have something in my\n",
      "possession which excuses my conduct.\" Agitated now in my turn, I held out my hand. \"Not while that woman remains in the room.\" Seeing him implacable, I returned to Mrs. \"I must entreat you to come with me,\" said I. \" Where is Sandra?

      "------------\n",
      " questioned\n",
      "whether the block system as developed in England is likely to\n",
      "be generally adopted on American railroads. Upon one or two of\n",
      "them, and notably on the New Jersey Central and a division of the\n",
      "Pennsylvania, it has already been in use for a number of years. From an American point of view, however, it is open to a number\n",
      "of objections. Sandra went back to the bathroom. That in itself it is very perfect and has been\n",
      "successfully elaborated so as to provide for almost every possible\n",
      "contingency is proved by the results daily accomplished by means of\n",
      "it. [13] The English lines are made to do an incredible amount of\n",
      "work with comparative few accidents. The block system is, however,\n",
      "none the less a very clumsy and complicated one, necessitating the\n",
      "constant employment of a large number of skilled operators. Here\n",
      "is the great defect in it from the American point of view. Mary journeyed to the bedroom. In this\n",
      "country labor is scarce and capital costly. John journeyed to the bathroom. The effort is always\n",
      "towards the perfecting of labor-saving machines. Sandra moved to the bedroom. Hitherto the\n",
      "pressure of traffic on the lines has not been greater than could\n",
      "be fairly controlled by simpler appliances, and the expense of the\n",
      "English system is so heavy that its adoption, except partially,\n",
      "would not have been warranted. As Barry says in his treatise on the\n",
      "subject, \"one can 'buy gold too dear'; for if every possible known\n",
      "precaution is to be taken, regardless of cost, it may not pay to\n",
      "work a railway at all.\" [13] An excellent popular description of this system will be found\n",
      "  in Barry's _Railway Appliances, Chapter V_. It is tolerably safe, therefore, to predict that the American\n",
      "block system of the future will be essentially different from the\n",
      "present English system. The basis--electricity--will of course be\n",
      "the same; but, while the operator is everywhere in the English\n",
      "block, his place will be supplied to the utmost possible degree by\n",
      "automatic action in the American. It is in this direction that the\n",
      "whole movement since the Revere disaster has been going on, and\n",
      "the advance has been very great. From peculiarities of condition\n",
      "also the American block must be made to cover a multitude of weak\n",
      "points in the operation of roads, and give timely notice of dangers\n",
      "against which the English block provides only to a limited degree,\n",
      "and always through the presence of yet other employés. For instance,\n",
      "as will presently be seen, many more accidents and, in Europe even,\n",
      "far greater loss of life is caused by locomotives coming in contact\n",
      "with vehicles at points where highways cross railroad tracks at a\n",
      "level therewith than by rear-end collisions; meanwhile throughout\n",
      "America, even in the most crowded suburban neighborhoods, these\n",
      "crossings are the rule, whereas in Europe they are the exception. The English block affords protection against this danger by giving\n",
      "electric notice to gatemen; but gatemen are always supposed. So\n",
      "also as respects the movements of passengers in and about stations\n",
      "in crossing tracks as they come to or leave the trains, or prepare\n",
      "to take their places in them. The rule in Europe is that passenger\n",
      "crossings at local stations are provided over or under the tracks;\n",
      "in America, however, almost nowhere is any provision at all made,\n",
      "but passengers, men, women and children, are left to scramble across\n",
      "tracks as best they can in the face of passing trains. They are\n",
      "expected to take care of themselves, and the success with which they\n",
      "do it is most astonishing. Having been brought up to this self-care\n",
      "all their lives, they do not, as would naturally be supposed, become\n",
      "confused and stumble under the wheels of locomotives; and the\n",
      "statistics seem to show that no more accidents from this cause occur\n",
      "in America than in Europe. Nevertheless some provision is manifestly\n",
      "desirable to notify employés as well as passengers that trains are\n",
      "approaching, especially where way-stations are situated on curves. Again, it is well known that, next to collisions, the greatest\n",
      "source of danger to railroad trains is due to broken tracks. It\n",
      "is, of course, apparent that tracks may at any time be broken by\n",
      "accident, as by earth-slides, derailment or the fracture of rails. This danger has to be otherwise provided for; the block has nothing\n",
      "to do with it further than to prevent a train delayed by any such\n",
      "break from being run into by any following train. The broken track\n",
      "which the perfect block should give notice of is that where the\n",
      "break is a necessary incident to the regular operation of the road. It is these breaks which, both in America and elsewhere, are the\n",
      "fruitful source of the great majority of railroad accidents, and\n",
      "draw-bridges and switches, or facing points as they are termed in\n",
      "the English\n",
      "------------\n",
      " reports, are most prominent among them. Wherever there\n",
      "is a switch, the chances are that in the course of time there will\n",
      "be an accident. Sandra travelled to the hallway. Four matters connected with train movement have now been specified,\n",
      "in regard to which some provision is either necessary or highly\n",
      "desirable: these are rear collisions, tracks broken at draw-bridges\n",
      "or at switches, highway grade crossings, and the notification of\n",
      "agents and passengers at stations. The effort in America, somewhat\n",
      "in advance of that crowded condition of the lines which makes the\n",
      "adoption of something a measure of present necessity, has been\n",
      "directed towards the invention of an automatic system which at\n",
      "one and the same time should cover all the dangers and provide\n",
      "for all the needs which have been referred to, eliminating the\n",
      "risks incident to human forgetfulness, drowsiness and weakness of\n",
      "nerves. Can reliable automatic provision thus be made?--The English\n",
      "authorities are of opinion that it cannot. Sandra travelled to the garden. They insist that \"if\n",
      "automatic arrangements be adopted, however suitable they may be to\n",
      "the duties which they have to perform, they should in all cases be\n",
      "used as additions to, and not as substitutions for, safety machinery\n",
      "worked by competent signal-men. The signal-man should be bound to\n",
      "exercise his observation, care and judgment, and to act thereon; and\n",
      "the machine, as far as possible, be such that if he attempts to go\n",
      "wrong it shall check him.\" It certainly cannot be said that the American electrician has as\n",
      "yet demonstrated the incorrectness of this conclusion, but he has\n",
      "undoubtedly made a good deal of progress in that direction. Sandra travelled to the bathroom. Of the\n",
      "various automatic blocks which have now been experimented with or\n",
      "brought into practice, the Hall Electric and the Union Safety Signal\n",
      "Company systems have been developed to a very marked degree of\n",
      "perfection. They depend for their working on diametrically opposite\n",
      "principles: the Hall signals being worked by means of an electric\n",
      "circuit caused by the action of wheels moving on the rails, and\n",
      "conveyed through the usual medium of wires; while, under the other\n",
      "system, the wires being wholly dispensed with, a continuous electric\n",
      "circuit is kept up by means of the rails, which are connected\n",
      "for the purpose, and the signals are then acted upon through the\n",
      "breaking of this normal circuit by the movement of locomotives and\n",
      "cars. So far as the signals are concerned, there is no essential\n",
      "difference between the two systems, except that Hall supplies the\n",
      "necessary motive force by the direct action of electricity, while in\n",
      "the other case dependence is placed upon suspended weights. Of the\n",
      "two the Hall system is the oldest and most thoroughly elaborated,\n",
      "having been compelled to pass through that long and useful tentative\n",
      "process common to all inventions, during which they are regarded\n",
      "as of doubtful utility and are gradually developed through a\n",
      "succession of partial failures. So far as Hall's system is concerned\n",
      "this period may now fairly be regarded as over, for it is in\n",
      "established use on a number of the more crowded roads of the North,\n",
      "and especially of New England, while the imperfections necessarily\n",
      "incident to the development of an appliance at once so delicate and\n",
      "so complicated, have for certain purposes been clearly overcome. Its signal arrangements, for instance, to protect draw-bridges,\n",
      "stations and grade-crossings are wholly distinct from its block\n",
      "system, through which it provides against dangers from collision and\n",
      "broken tracks. Daniel journeyed to the kitchen. So far as draw-bridges are concerned, the protection\n",
      "it affords is perfect. Not only is its interlocking apparatus so\n",
      "designed that the opening of the draw blocks all approach to it,\n",
      "but the signals are also reciprocal; and if through carelessness or\n",
      "automatic derangement any train passes the block, the draw-tender is\n",
      "notified at once of the fact in ample time to stop it. In the case of a highway crossing at a level, the electric bell\n",
      "under Hall's system is placed at the crossing, giving notice of\n",
      "the approaching train from the moment it is within half a mile\n",
      "until it passes; so that, where this appliance is in use, accidents\n",
      "can happen only through the gross carelessness of those using the\n",
      "highway. When the electric bell is silent there is no train within\n",
      "half a mile and the crossing is safe; it is not safe while the bell\n",
      "is ringing. As it now stands the law usually provides that the\n",
      "prescribed signals, either bell or whistle, shall be given from the\n",
      "locomotive as it approaches the highway, and at a fixed distance\n",
      "from it. The signal, therefore, is given at a distance of several\n",
      "hundred yards, more or less, from the point of danger. The electric\n",
      "system improves on this by placing the signal directly at the point\n",
      "of danger\n",
      "------------\n",
      ",--the traveller approaches the bell, instead of the bell\n",
      "approaching the traveller. At any point of crossing which is really\n",
      "dangerous,--that is at any crossing where trees or cuttings or\n",
      "buildings mask the railroad from the highway,--this distinction is\n",
      "vital. In the one case notice of the unseen danger must be given\n",
      "and cannot be unobserved; in the other case whether it is really\n",
      "given or not may depend on the condition of the atmosphere or the\n",
      "direction of the wind. Usually, however, in New England the level crossings of the more\n",
      "crowded thoroughfares, perhaps one in ten of the whole number, are\n",
      "protected by gates or flag-men. Under similar circumstances in\n",
      "Great Britain there is an electric connection between a bell in the\n",
      "cabin of the gate-keeper and the nearest signal boxes of the block\n",
      "system on each side of the crossing, so that due notice is given of\n",
      "the approach of trains from either direction. In this country it has\n",
      "heretofore been the custom to warn gate-keepers by the locomotive\n",
      "whistle, to the intense annoyance of all persons dwelling near the\n",
      "crossing, or to make them depend for notice on their own eyes. Under\n",
      "the Hall system, however, the gate-keeper is automatically signalled\n",
      "to be on the look out, if he is attending to his duty; or, if he is\n",
      "neglecting it, the electric bell in some degree supplies his place,\n",
      "without releasing the corporation from its liability. In America\n",
      "the heavy fogs of England are almost unknown, and the brilliant\n",
      "head lights, heavy bells and shrill high whistles in use on the\n",
      "locomotives would at night, it might be supposed, give ample notice\n",
      "to the most careless of an approaching train. Continually recurring\n",
      "experience shows, however, that this is not the case. Under these\n",
      "circumstances the electric bell at the crossing becomes not only a\n",
      "matter of justice almost to the employé who is stationed there, but\n",
      "a watchman over him. This, however, like the other forms of signals which have been\n",
      "referred to, is, in the electric system, a mere adjunct of its chief\n",
      "use, which is the block,--they are all as it were things thrown\n",
      "into the bargain. As contradistinguished from the English block,\n",
      "which insures only an unoccupied track, the automatic blocks seek to\n",
      "insure an unbroken track as well,--that is not only is each segment\n",
      "into which a road is divided, protected as respects following trains\n",
      "by, in the case of Hall's system, double signals watching over each\n",
      "other, the one at safety, the other at danger,--both having to\n",
      "combine to open the block,--but every switch or facing point, the\n",
      "throwing of which may break the main track, is also protected. The\n",
      "Union Signal Company's system it is claimed goes still further than\n",
      "this and indicates any break in the track, though due to accidental\n",
      "fracture or displacement of rails. Without attempting this the Hall\n",
      "system has one other important feature in common with the English\n",
      "block, and a very important feature, that of enabling station agents\n",
      "in case of sudden emergency to control the train movement within\n",
      "half a mile or more of their stations on either side. John journeyed to the office. Within the\n",
      "given distance they can stop trains either leaving or approaching. The inability to do this has been the cause of some of the most\n",
      "disastrous collisions on record, and notably those at Revere and at\n",
      "Thorpe. The one essential thing, however, in every perfect block system,\n",
      "whether automatic or worked by operators, is that in case of\n",
      "accident or derangement or doubt, the signal should rest at danger. This the Hall system now fully provides for, and in case even of\n",
      "the wilful displacement of a switch, an occurrence by no means\n",
      "without precedent in railroad experience, the danger signal could\n",
      "not but be displayed, even though the electric connection had been\n",
      "tampered with. Accidents due to wilfullness, however, can hardly\n",
      "be provided for except by police precautions. Train wrecking is\n",
      "not to be taken into account as a danger incident to the ordinary\n",
      "operation of a railroad. Carelessness or momentary inadvertence,\n",
      "or, most dangerous of all, that recklessness--that unnecessary\n",
      "assumption of risk somewhere or at some time, which is almost\n",
      "inseparable from a long immunity from disaster--these are the\n",
      "great sources of peril most carefully to be guarded against. The\n",
      "complicated and unceasing train movement depends upon many thousand\n",
      "employés, all of whom make mistakes or assume risks sometimes;--and\n",
      "did they not do so they would be either more or less than men. Being, however, neither angels nor machines, but Where is Sandra?  Answer with a single word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "and greatest power and deposed him from his kingly office. In those\n",
      "days a change of government, a change of policy, the getting rid of\n",
      "a bad minister and the putting a better in his place, were things\n",
      "which never could be done without an open struggle between King and\n",
      "Parliament; often they could not be done without the bondage, the\n",
      "imprisonment, or the death, perhaps only of the minister, perhaps even\n",
      "of the King himself. The same ends can now be gained by a vote of\n",
      "censure in the House of Commons; in many cases they can be gained even\n",
      "without a vote of censure, by the simple throwing out of a measure by\n",
      "which a Ministry has given out that it will stand or fall(56). The fifteenth century, as compared with the thirteenth and fourteenth,\n",
      "was in some respects a time in which things went back. It is plain\n",
      "that the Parliaments of that day were bodies which were much less\n",
      "independent than the Parliaments of earlier times. During the Wars of\n",
      "the Roses each successive military victor found a Parliament ready to\n",
      "confirm his claim to the Crown and to decree the condemnation of his\n",
      "enemies(57). And it was a Parliament of Henry the Sixth which passed\n",
      "the most reactionary measure which any Parliament ever did pass,\n",
      "that by which the qualification for a county elector was narrowed to\n",
      "those freeholders whose estates were of the yearly value of forty\n",
      "shillings(58). In this case time and the change in the value of money\n",
      "have redressed the wrong; there may be freeholders whose estates are\n",
      "under the value of forty shillings, but I cannot think that they are\n",
      "now a very large or important class. But, to understand the meaning of\n",
      "the restriction in the fifteenth century, for forty shillings we may\n",
      "fairly read forty pounds; and certainly, if we struck off the register\n",
      "all those electors whose qualification is a freehold—much more those\n",
      "whose qualification is an estate less than a freehold—under the value\n",
      "of forty pounds, the lessening of the constituencies of our counties\n",
      "would not be small. On the other hand, during the revolutionary times\n",
      "which followed, we more than once hear of direct appeals to the people\n",
      "\n",
      "------------\n",
      "which remind us of days far earlier. Edward the Fourth and Richard the\n",
      "Third were chosen Kings, or at least had their claims to the Crown\n",
      "acknowledged, by gatherings of the citizens of London which remind us\n",
      "of the wars of Stephen and Matilda(59). Still even in this age, the\n",
      "power of Parliament was advancing(60); the anxiety of every pretender\n",
      "to get a parliamentary sanction for his claims was a sign of the\n",
      "growing importance of Parliament, and we get incidental notices which\n",
      "show that a seat in the House of Commons, and that not as a knight of a\n",
      "shire, but as a burgess of a borough, was now an object of ambition for\n",
      "men of the class from which knights of the shire were chosen, and even\n",
      "for the sons of members of the Upper House(61). At last came the sixteenth century, the time of trial for parliamentary\n",
      "institutions in so many countries of Europe. Daniel travelled to the kitchen. Not a few assemblies which\n",
      "had once been as free as our own Parliament were, during that age,\n",
      "either utterly swept away or reduced to empty formalities. Then it\n",
      "was that Charles the Fifth and Philip the Second overthrew the free\n",
      "constitutions of Castile and Aragon; before long the States-General\n",
      "of France met for the last time before their last meeting of all\n",
      "on the eve of the great Revolution(62). In England parliamentary\n",
      "institutions were not swept away, nor did Parliament sink into an empty\n",
      "form. But, for a while, Parliaments, like all our other institutions,\n",
      "became perverted into instruments of tyranny. Under Henry the Eighth,\n",
      "Parliaments, like Judges, Juries, and ecclesiastical Synods, decreed\n",
      "whatever seemed good to the caprice of the despot. Why had they so\n",
      "fallen away from what they had been in a past age, from what they\n",
      "were to be again? The reason is plain; the Commons had not yet gained\n",
      "strength enough to act without the Lords, and the Lords had ceased to\n",
      "be an independent body. The old nobility had been cut off at Towton\n",
      "and Barnet, and the new nobility were the abject slaves of the King\n",
      "to whom they owed their honours. A century later, the new nobility\n",
      "had inherited the spirit of the old, and the Commons had grown to the\n",
      "fulness of their power. Thus it came that we find in the Parliaments\n",
      "of the sixteenth century an abject submission to a tyrant’s will, of\n",
      "which we find no sign in the Parliaments either of the fourteenth or\n",
      "of the seventeenth. Very different indeed from the Parliaments which\n",
      "overthrew Richard the Second and Charles the First were the Parliaments\n",
      "which, almost without a question, passed bills of attainder against\n",
      "any man against whom Henry’s caprice had turned, the Parliaments\n",
      "which, in the great age of religious controversy, were ever ready\n",
      "to enforce by every penalty that particular shade of doctrine which\n",
      "for the moment commended itself to the Defender of the Faith, to his\n",
      "son or to his daughters. Why, it may be asked, in such a state of\n",
      "things, did not parliamentary institutions perish in England as they\n",
      "perished in so many other lands? It might be enough to say that no\n",
      "ruler had an interest in destroying institutions which he found that\n",
      "he could so conveniently turn to his own purposes. But why did not\n",
      "those institutions sink into mere forms, which they certainly did not\n",
      "do, even in the worst times? One reason undoubtedly is that special\n",
      "insular position of our country which has in so many other ways\n",
      "given a peculiar turn to our history. The great foe of parliamentary\n",
      "institutions was the introduction of standing armies. But the sovereign\n",
      "of England, shut up within his island, had far less need of a standing\n",
      "army than the sovereigns of the Continent, engaged as they were in\n",
      "their ceaseless wars with neighbours on their frontiers. But I believe\n",
      "that the personal character of Henry the Eighth had a great deal to\n",
      "do with the final preservation of our liberties. Do not for a moment\n",
      "fancy that I belong to that school of paradox which sets up Henry the\n",
      "Eighth as a virtuous and beneficent ruler. Do not think that I claim\n",
      "for him any feelings of direct thankfulness such as I do claim for\n",
      "Earl Simon and King Edward. The position of Henry is more like the\n",
      "position of William the Conqueror, though I certainly hold that the\n",
      "Conqueror was in everything the better man of the two. Both served the\n",
      "cause of freedom indirectly, and both served it by means of features\n",
      "in the personal character of each. In one respect indeed William and\n",
      "Henry stood in utterly different positions towards England. William was\n",
      "a stranger, and it was largely because he was\n",
      "------------\n",
      " a stranger that he was\n",
      "able to do us indirect good. Henry, with all his crimes, was a thorough\n",
      "Englishman; throughout his reign there was a sympathy between him and\n",
      "the mass of his subjects, who, after all, did not greatly suffer by the\n",
      "occasional beheading of a Queen or a Duke. But the despotism of William\n",
      "and the despotism of Henry agreed in this, that each, even in his worst\n",
      "deeds, retained a scrupulous regard for the letter of the Law. Sandra went back to the bathroom. In the\n",
      "case of William this is not hard to see for any one who carefully\n",
      "studies the records of his age(63); in the case of Henry it stands\n",
      "boldly proclaimed in the broadest facts of English history. While his\n",
      "fellow-tyrants abroad were everywhere overthrowing free institutions,\n",
      "Henry was in all things showing them the deepest outward respect. Throughout his reign he took care to do nothing except in outward and\n",
      "regular legal form, nothing for which he could not shelter himself\n",
      "under the sanction either of precedent or of written Law. In itself,\n",
      "this perversion of Law, this clothing of wrong with the garb of right,\n",
      "is really worse—at all events it is more corrupting—than deeds of open\n",
      "violence against which men are tempted openly to revolt. But such a\n",
      "tyranny as Henry’s is one form of the homage which vice pays to virtue;\n",
      "the careful preservation of the outward forms of freedom makes it\n",
      "easier for another and happier generation again to kindle the form into\n",
      "its ancient spirit and life. Every deed of wrong done by Henry with the\n",
      "assent of Parliament was in truth a witness to the abiding importance\n",
      "of Parliament; the very degradation of our ancient Constitution was a\n",
      "step to its revival with new strength and in a more perfect form(64). A like witness to the importance of Parliament in this age was shown\n",
      "in two other very remarkable ways, whereby the power and importance of\n",
      "the House of Commons was acknowledged in the very act of corrupting\n",
      "it. Sandra went to the kitchen. One was the active interference of the Government in parliamentary\n",
      "elections; the other was the creation of boroughs in order to be\n",
      "corrupt. One needs no stronger proofs than these of the importance\n",
      "of the body which it was found needful thus to pack and to manage. The Crown still kept the power of summoning members from any boroughs\n",
      "which it thought fit, and throughout the Tudor reigns the power was\n",
      "freely abused by sending writs to places which were likely to return\n",
      "members who would be subservient to the Court(65). Thus arose many\n",
      "of the wretched little boroughs in Cornwall and elsewhere which were\n",
      "disfranchised by our successive Reform Bills. These boroughs, which\n",
      "always were corrupt and which were created in order to be corrupt, must\n",
      "be carefully distinguished from another class which perished with them. Many towns to which Earl Simon and King Edward sent writs decayed in\n",
      "process of time; sometimes they decayed positively; more commonly they\n",
      "decayed relatively, by being utterly outstripped by younger towns and\n",
      "so losing the importance which they had once had. The disfranchisement\n",
      "of both classes was equally just; but the different history of the two\n",
      "classes should be carefully borne in mind. It was right to take away\n",
      "its members from Old Sarum, but there had been a time when it was right\n",
      "to give Old Sarum members. In the case of a crowd of Cornish boroughs,\n",
      "it not only was right to take away their members, but they never ought\n",
      "to have had members at all(66). It was in the days of Elizabeth that something of the ancient spirit\n",
      "again breathed forth. It is then that we come to the beginning of that\n",
      "long line of parliamentary worthies which stretches on in unbroken\n",
      "order from her days to our own. A few daring spirits in the Commons’\n",
      "House now began once more to speak in tones worthy of those great\n",
      "Assemblies which had taught the Edwards and the Richards that there\n",
      "was a power in England mightier than their own(67). Under the puny\n",
      "successor of the great Queen the voice of freedom was heard more\n",
      "loudly(68). In the next reign the great strife of all came, and a King\n",
      "of England once more, as in the days of Henry and Simon, stood forth\n",
      "in arms against his people to learn that the power of his people was\n",
      "a greater power than his. But in the seventeenth century, just as in\n",
      "the thirteenth, men did not ask for any rights and powers which were\n",
      "admitted to be new; they asked only for the better security of those\n",

      "morbid processes occurring in parts or organs in anatomical relation to\n",

      "production of hepatic abscess. Those warm countries visited by\n",

      "this disease. Hirsch,[84] whilst recognizing the influence of climate,\n",
      "shows that the natives are not affected to the same extent as are\n",
      "Europeans. Both writers maintain that hepatic abscess does not occur\n",
      "frequently in the corresponding parallels of latitude in the United\n",
      "States; which is true of the Atlantic border, but is not correct for\n",
      "the interior continent, the valley of the Mississippi, and its\n",
      "tributaries. In this vast region the conditions for the production of\n",
      "hepatitis exist abundantly. The mean annual temperature, the\n",
      "malaria-breeding soil, the social and personal habits of the people\n",
      "(males), combine to favor the production of hepatic abscess. As the\n",
      "native population and females in tropical countries are not affected,\n",
      "there must be other influences to the action of which the high\n",
      "temperature contributes. The rich and highly-seasoned food in which\n",

      "X-Kanchacan, where are situated the ruins of the ancient city of\n",

      "unless the spell was removed. He was emaciated, seemed to suffer from\n",
      "malarial fever, then prevalent in the place, and from the presence of\n",
      "tapeworm. I told him I could restore him to health if he would heed my\n",
      "advice. The fellow stared at me for some time, trying to find out,\n",
      "probably, if I was a stronger wizard than the _H-Men_ who had bewitched\n",
      "him. He must have failed to discover on my face the proverbial\n",
      "distinctive marks great sorcerers are said to possess; for, with an\n",
      "incredulous grin, stretching his thin lips tighter over his teeth, he\n",
      "simply replied: \"No use--I am bewitched--there is no remedy for me.\" Du Chaillu, speaking of the superstitions of the inhabitants of\n",
      "Equatorial Africa, says: \"The greatest curse of the whole country is the\n",
      "belief in sorcery or witchcraft. If the African is once possessed with\n",
      "the belief that he is bewitched his whole nature seems to change. He\n",
      "becomes suspicious of his dearest friends. He fancies himself sick, and\n",
      "really often becomes sick through his fears. At least seventy-five per\n",
      "cent of the deaths in all the tribes are murders for supposed sorcery.\" In that they differ from the natives of Yucatan, who respect wizards\n",
      "because of their supposed supernatural powers. From the most remote antiquity, as we learn from the writings of the\n",
      "chroniclers, in all sacred ceremonies the Mayas used to make copious\n",
      "libations with _Balche_. To-day the aborigines still use it in the\n",

      "bark of a tree called Balche, soaked in water, mixed with honey and left\n",
      "to ferment. The nectar drank by\n",
      "the God of Greek Mythology. Du Chaillu, speaking of the recovery to health of the King of _Mayo_lo,\n",

      "pieces of bark of a certain tree_.\" (Journey to Ashango Land, page 183.) I will remark here that, by a strange _coincidence_, we not only find\n",
      "that the inhabitants of Equatorial Africa have customs identical with\n",
      "the MAYAS, but that the name of one of their cities MAYO_lo_, seems to\n",
      "be a corruption of MAYAB. The Africans make offerings upon the graves of their departed friends,\n",
      "where they deposit furniture, dress and food--and sometimes slay slaves,\n",
      "men and women, over the graves of kings and chieftains, with the belief\n",
      "that their spirits join that of him in whose honor they have been\n",
      "sacrificed. I have already said that it was customary with the Mayas to place in the\n",
      "tombs part of the riches of the deceased and the implements of his trade\n",
      "or profession; and that the great quantity of blood found scattered\n",
      "round the slab on which the statue of Chaacmol is reclining would tend\n",
      "to suggest that slaves were sacrificed at his funeral. The Mayas of old were wont to abandon the house where a person had died. Many still observe that same custom when they can afford to do so; for\n",
      "they believe that the spirit of the departed hovers round it. The Africans also abandon their houses, remove even the site of their\n",
      "villages when death frequently occur;[TN-30] for, say they, the place is\n",
      "no longer good; and they fear the spirits of those recently deceased. Among the musical instruments used by the Mayas there were two kinds of\n",
      "drums--the _Tunkul_ and the _Zacatan_. They are still used by the\n",
      "aborigines in their religious festivals and dances. The _Tunkul_ is a cylinder hollowed from the trunk of a tree, so as to\n",
      "leave it about one inch in thickness all round. It is generally about\n",
      "four feet in length. Mary moved to the office. On one side two slits are cut, so as to leave\n",
      "between them a strip of about four inches in width, to within six inches\n",
      "from the ends; this strip is divided in the middle, across, so as to\n",
      "form, as it were, tongues. It is by striking on those tongues with two\n",
      "balls of india-rubber, attached to the end of sticks, that the\n",
      "instrument is played. The volume of sound produced is so great that it\n",
      "can be heard, is[TN-31] is said, at a distance of six miles in calm\n",
      "weather. The _Zacatan_ is another sort of drum, also hollowed from the\n",
      "trunk of a tree. On one end a piece of\n",
      "skin is tightly stretched. It is by beating on the skin with the hand,\n",
      "the instrument being supported between the legs of the drummer, in a\n",
      "slanting position, that it is played. Du Chaillu, Stanley and other travelers in Africa tell us that, in case\n",
      "of danger and to call the clans together, the big war drum is beaten,\n",
      "and is heard many miles around. Du Chaillu asserts having seen one of\n",
      "these _Ngoma_, formed of a hollow log, nine feet long, at Apono; and\n",
      "describes a _Fan_ drum which corresponds to the _Zacatan_ of the Mayas\n",
      "as follows: \"The cylinder was about four feet long and ten inches in\n",
      "diameter at one end, but only seven at the other. Sandra journeyed to the kitchen. The wood was hollowed\n",
      "out quite thin, and the skin stretched over tightly. To beat it the\n",
      "drummer held it slantingly between his legs, and with two sticks\n",
      "beats[TN-32] furiously upon the upper, which was the larger end of the\n",

      "Peers was to write and ask each individual Member his opinion on the\n",

      "existence of a draw in the bridge on which it happened to occur, it\n",
      "was, indeed, entitled to respect, and yet it was on this very point\n",
      "that it excited the most criticism. Loud commendation was heard\n",
      "through the press of the Connecticut law, which had been in force\n",
      "for twenty years, and, indeed, still is in force there, under which\n",
      "all trains are compelled to come to a full stop before entering\n",

      "described as a useless nuisance. Yet the grand jury of the Court of\n",

      "in a report made by it on the 23d of February, 1871,--sixteen days\n",
      "after the accident,--the passage by the legislature then in session\n",
      "at Albany of a similar legal absurdity. Fortunately better counsels\n",
      "prevailed, and, as the public recovered its equilibrium, the matter\n",
      "was allowed to drop. The Connecticut law in question, however, originated in an accident\n",
      "which at the time had startled and shocked the community as much\n",
      "even as that at Versailles did before or that at Abergele has since\n",
      "done. It occurred to an express train on the New York & New Haven\n",
      "road at Norwalk, in Connecticut, on the 6th of May, 1853. CHAPTER X.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE NORWALK ACCIDENT. Mary travelled to the office. The railroad at Norwalk crosses a small inlet of Long Island Sound\n",
      "by means of a draw-bridge, which is approached from the direction\n",
      "of New York around a sharp curve. John travelled to the bathroom. A ball at the mast-head was in\n",

      "the passage of trains. The express passenger train for Boston,\n",
      "consisting of a locomotive and two baggage and five passenger cars,\n",
      "containing about one hundred and fifty persons, left New York as\n",
      "usual at eight o'clock that morning. The locomotive was not in\n",
      "charge of its usual engine-driver but of a substitute named Tucker;\n",
      "a man who some seven years before had been injured in a previous\n",
      "collision on the same road, for which he did not appear to have\n",
      "been in any way responsible, but who had then given up his position\n",
      "and gone to California, whence he had recently returned and was now\n",
      "again an applicant for an engineer's situation. This was his third\n",
      "trip over the road, as substitute. In approaching the bridge at\n",
      "Norwalk he apparently wholly neglected to look for the draw-signal. He was running his train at about the usual rate of speed, and\n",
      "first became aware that the draw was open when within four hundred\n",
      "feet of it and after it had become wholly impossible to stop the\n",
      "train in time. He immediately whistled for brakes and reversed his\n",
      "engine, and then, without setting the brake on his tender, both he\n",
      "and the fireman sprang off and escaped with trifling injuries. Mary went to the bathroom. The\n",
      "train at this time did not appear to be moving at a speed of over\n",
      "fifteen miles an hour. John travelled to the kitchen. The draw was sixty feet in width; the water\n",
      "in the then state of the tide was about twelve feet deep, and the\n",
      "same distance below the level of the bridge. Although the speed\n",
      "of the train had been materially reduced, yet when it came to the\n",
      "opening it was still moving with sufficient impetus to send its\n",
      "locomotive clean across the sixty foot interval and to cause it to\n",
      "strike the opposite abutment about eight feet below the track; it\n",
      "then fell heavily to the bottom. The tender lodged on top of the\n",
      "locomotive, bottom up and resting against the pier, while\n",
      "------------\n",
      " on top\n",
      "of this again was the first baggage car. The second baggage car,\n",
      "which contained also a compartment for smokers, followed, but in\n",
      "falling was canted over to the north side of the draw in such a way\n",
      "as not to be wholly submerged, so that most of those in it were\n",
      "saved. The first passenger car next plunged into the opening; its\n",
      "forward end crushed in, as it fell against the baggage car in front\n",
      "of it, while its rear end dropped into the deep water below; and\n",
      "on top of it came the second passenger car, burying the passengers\n",
      "in the first beneath the _débris_, and itself partially submerged. The succeeding or third passenger car, instead of following the\n",
      "others, broke in two in the middle, the forward part hanging down\n",
      "over the edge of the draw, while the rear of it rested on the track\n",
      "and stayed the course of the remainder of the train. Including those\n",
      "in the smoking compartment more than a hundred persons were plunged\n",
      "into the channel, of whom forty-six lost their lives, while some\n",
      "thirty others were more or less severely injured. The killed were\n",
      "mainly among the passengers in the first car; for, in falling, the\n",
      "roof of the second car was split open, and it finally rested in such\n",
      "a position that, as no succeeding car came on top of it, many of\n",
      "those in it were enabled to extricate themselves; indeed, more than\n",
      "one of the passengers in falling were absolutely thrown through the\n",
      "aperture in the roof, and, without any volition on their part, were\n",
      "saved with unmoistened garments. John went back to the bathroom. Shocking as this catastrophe was, it was eclipsed in horror by\n",
      "another exactly similar in character, though from the peculiar\n",
      "circumstances of the case it excited far less public notice, which\n",
      "occurred eleven years later on the Grand Trunk railway of Canada. In this case a large party of emigrants, over 500 in number and\n",
      "chiefly Poles, Germans and Norwegians of the better class, had\n",
      "landed at Quebec and were being forwarded on a special train to\n",
      "their destination in the West. With their baggage they filled\n",
      "thirteen cars. The Grand Trunk on the way to Montreal crosses the\n",
      "Richelieu river at Beloeil by an iron bridge, in the westernmost\n",
      "span of which was a draw over the canal, some 45 feet below it. Both\n",
      "by law and under the running rules of the road all trains were to\n",
      "come to a dead stand on approaching the bridge, and to proceed only\n",
      "when the safety signal was clearly discerned. This rule, however,\n",
      "as it appeared at the subsequent inquest, had been systematically\n",
      "disobeyed, it having been considered sufficient if the train was\n",
      "\"slowed down.\" In the present case, however--the night of June 29,\n",
      "1864,--though the danger signal was displayed and in full sight\n",
      "for a distance of 1,600 feet, the engine-driver, unfamiliar with\n",
      "the road and its signals, failed to see it, and, without slowing\n",
      "his train even, ran directly onto the bridge. He became aware of\n",
      "the danger when too late to stop. The draw was open to permit the\n",
      "passage of a steamer with six barges in tow, one of which was\n",
      "directly under the opening. The whole train went through the draw,\n",
      "sinking the barge and piling itself up in the water on top of it. The three last cars, falling on the accumulated wreck, toppled over\n",
      "upon the west embankment and were thus less injured than the others. The details of the accident were singularly distressing. \"As soon\n",
      "as possible a strong cable was attached to the upper part of the\n",
      "piling, and by this means two cars, the last of the ill-fated train,\n",
      "were dragged onto the wharf under the bridge. A shapeless blue mass of hands and heads and feet\n",
      "protruded among the splinters and frame-work, and gradually resolved\n",
      "itself into a closely-packed mass of human beings, all ragged and\n",
      "bloody and dinted from crown to foot with blue bruises and weals\n",
      "and cuts inflicted by the ponderous iron work, the splinters and\n",
      "the enormous weight of the train. * * * A great many of the dead\n",
      "had evidently been asleep; the majority of them had taken off their\n",
      "boots and coats in the endeavor to make themselves as comfortable\n",
      "as possible. They lay heaped upon one another like sacks, dressed\n",
      "in the traditional blue clothing of the German people. * * * A\n",
