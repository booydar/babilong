       "  'content': '<context>\\nPresently, indeed, there appeared an able _extrait_ of\\nGrampus\\'s article in the valuable _Rapporteur scientifique et\\nhistorique_, and Merman\\'s mistakes were thus brought under the notice of\\ncertain Frenchmen who are among the masters of those who know on\\noriental subjects. In a word, Merman, though not extensively read, was\\nextensively read about. Perhaps nobody, except his wife, for a\\nmoment reflected on that. An amused society considered that he was\\nseverely punished, but did not take the trouble to imagine his\\nsensations; indeed this would have been a difficulty for persons less\\nsensitive and excitable than Merman himself. Perhaps that popular\\ncomparison of the Walrus had truth enough to bite and blister on\\nthorough application, even if exultant ignorance had not applauded it. But it is well known that the walrus, though not in the least a\\nmalignant animal, if allowed to display its remarkably plain person and\\nblundering performances at ease in any element it chooses, becomes\\ndesperately savage and musters alarming auxiliaries when attacked or\\nhurt. In this characteristic, at least, Merman resembled the walrus. And\\nnow he concentrated himself with a vengeance. That his counter-theory\\nwas fundamentally the right one he had a genuine conviction, whatever\\ncollateral mistakes he might have committed; and his bread would not\\ncease to be bitter to him until he had convinced his contemporaries that\\nGrampus had used his minute learning as a dust-cloud to hide\\nsophistical evasions--that, in fact, minute learning was an obstacle to\\nclear-sighted judgment, more especially with regard to the Magicodumbras\\nand Zuzumotzis, and that the best preparation in this matter was a wide\\nsurvey of history and a diversified observation of men. Still, Merman\\nwas resolved to muster all the learning within his reach, and he\\nwandered day and night through many wildernesses of German print, he\\ntried compendious methods of learning oriental tongues, and, so to\\nspeak, getting at the marrow of languages independently of the bones,\\nfor the chance of finding details to corroborate his own views, or\\npossibly even to detect Grampus in some oversight or textual tampering. All other work was neglected: rare clients were sent away and amazed\\neditors found this maniac indifferent to his chance of getting\\nbook-parcels from them. It was many months before Merman had satisfied\\nhimself that he was strong enough to face round upon his adversary. But\\nat last he had prepared sixty condensed pages of eager argument which\\nseemed to him worthy to rank with the best models of controversial\\nwriting. He had acknowledged his mistakes, but had restated his theory\\nso as to show that it was left intact in spite of them; and he had even\\nfound cases in which Ziphius, Microps, Scrag Whale the explorer, and\\nother Cetaceans of unanswerable authority, were decidedly at issue with\\nGrampus. Especially a passage cited by this last from that greatest of\\nfossils Megalosaurus was demonstrated by Merman to be capable of three\\ndifferent interpretations, all preferable to that chosen by Grampus, who\\ntook the words in their most literal sense; for, 1 deg., the incomparable\\nSaurian, alike unequalled in close observation and far-glancing\\ncomprehensiveness, might have meant those words ironically; 2 deg., _motzis_\\nwas probably a false reading for _potzis_, in which case its bearing was\\nreversed; and 3 deg., it is known that in the age of the Saurians there\\nwere conceptions about the _motzis_ which entirely remove it from the\\ncategory of things comprehensible in an age when Saurians run\\nridiculously small: all which views were godfathered by names quite fit\\nto be ranked with that of Grampus. In fine, Merman wound up his\\nrejoinder by sincerely thanking the eminent adversary without whose\\nfierce assault he might not have undertaken a revision in the course of\\nwhich he had met with unexpected and striking confirmations of his own\\nfundamental views. Evidently Merman\\'s anger was at white heat. The rejoinder being complete, all that remained was to find a suitable\\nmedium for its publication. Distinguished mediums\\nwould not lend themselves to contradictions of Grampus, or if they\\nwould, Merman\\'s article was too long and too abstruse, while he would\\nnot consent to leave anything out of an article which had no\\nsuperfluities; for all this happened years ago when the world was at a\\ndifferent stage. At last, however, he got his rejoinder printed, and not\\non hard terms, since the medium, in every sense modest, did not ask him\\nto pay for its insertion. But if Merman expected to call out Grampus again, he was mistaken. Everybody felt it too absurd that Merman should undertake to correct\\nGrampus in matters of erudition, and an eminent man has something else\\nto do than to refute a petty objector twice over. What was essential had\\nbeen done: the public had been enabled to form a true judgment of\\nMerman\\'s incapacity, the Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis were but\\nsubsidiary elements in Grampus\\'s system, and Merman might now be dealt\\nwith by younger members of the master\\'s school. But he had at least the\\nsatisfaction of finding that he had raised a discussion which would not\\nbe let die. The followers of Grampus took it up with an ardour and\\nindustry of research worthy of their exemplar. Butzkopf made it the\\nsubject of an elaborate _Einleitung_ to his important work, _Die\\nBedeutung des Aegyptischen Labyrinthes_; and Dugong, in a remarkable\\naddress which he delivered to a learned society in Central Europe,\\nintroduced Merman\\'s theory with so much power of sarcasm that it became\\na theme of more or less derisive allusion to men of many tongues. Merman\\nwith his Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis was on the way to become a\\nproverb, being used illustratively by many able journalists who took\\nthose names of questionable things to be Merman\\'s own invention, \"than\\nwhich,\" said one of the graver guides, \"we can recall few more\\nmelancholy examples of speculative aberration.\" Naturally the subject\\npassed into popular literature, and figured very commonly in advertised\\nprogrammes. The fluent Loligo, the formidable Shark, and a younger\\nmember of his remarkable family known as S. Catulus, made a special\\nreputation by their numerous articles, eloquent, lively, or abusive, all\\non the same theme, under titles ingeniously varied, alliterative,\\nsonorous, or boldly fanciful; such as, \"Moments with Mr Merman,\" \"Mr\\nMerman and the Magicodumbras,\" \"Greenland Grampus and Proteus Merman,\"\\n\"Grampian Heights and their Climbers, or the New Excelsior.\" They tossed\\nhim on short sentences; they swathed him in paragraphs of winding\\nimagery; they found him at once a mere plagiarist and a theoriser of\\nunexampled perversity, ridiculously wrong about _potzis_ and ignorant of\\nPali; they hinted, indeed, at certain things which to their knowledge he\\nhad silently brooded over in his boyhood, and seemed tolerably well\\nassured that this preposterous attempt to gainsay an incomparable\\nCetacean of world-wide fame had its origin in a peculiar mixture of\\nbitterness and eccentricity which, rightly estimated and seen in its\\ndefinite proportions, would furnish the best key to his argumentation. All alike were sorry for Merman\\'s lack of sound learning, but how could\\ntheir readers be sorry? Sound learning would not have been amusing; and\\nas it was, Merman was made to furnish these readers with amusement at no\\nexpense of trouble on their part. Even burlesque writers looked into his\\nbook to see where it could be made use of, and those who did not know\\nhim were desirous of meeting him at dinner as one likely to feed their\\ncomic vein. On the other hand, he made a serious figure in sermons under the name of\\n\"Some\" or \"Others\" who had attempted presumptuously to scale eminences\\ntoo high and arduous for human ability, and had given an example of\\nignominious failure edifying to the humble Christian. All this might be very advantageous for able persons whose superfluous\\nfund of expression needed a paying investment, but the effect on Merman\\nhimself was unhappily not so transient as the busy writing and speaking\\nof which he had become the occasion. His certainty that he was right\\nnaturally got stronger in proportion as the spirit of resistance was\\nstimulated. The scorn and unfairness with which he felt himself to have\\nbeen treated by those really competent to appreciate his ideas had\\ngalled him and made a chronic sore; and the exultant chorus of the\\nincompetent seemed a pouring of vinegar on his wound. His brain became a\\nregistry of the foolish and ignorant objections made against him, and of\\ncontinually amplified answers to these objections. Unable to get his\\nanswers printed, he had recourse to that more primitive mode of\\npublication, oral transmission or button-holding, now generally regarded\\nas a troublesome survival, and the once pleasant, flexible Merman was on\\nthe way to be shunned as a bore. His interest in new acquaintances\\nturned chiefly on the possibility that they would care about the\\nMagicodumbras and Zuzumotzis; that they would listen to his complaints\\nand exposures of unfairness, and not only accept copies of what he had\\nwritten on the subject, but send him appreciative letters in\\nacknowledgment. Repeated disappointment of such hopes tended to embitter\\nhim, and not the less because after a while the fashion of mentioning\\nhim died out, allusions to his theory were less understood, and people\\ncould only pretend to remember it. And all the while Merman was\\nperfectly sure that his very opponents who had knowledge enough to be\\ncapable judges were aware that his book, whatever errors of statement\\nthey might detect in it, had served as a sort of divining rod, pointing\\nout hidden sources of historical interpretation; nay, his jealous\\nexamination discerned in a new work by Grampus himself a certain\\nshifting of ground which--so poor Merman declared--was the sign of an\\nintention gradually to appropriate the views of the man he had attempted\\nto brand as an ignorant impostor. And the housekeeping?--the rent, food, and clothing, which\\ncontroversy can hardly supply unless it be of the kind that serves as a\\nrecommendation to certain posts. Controversial pamphlets have been known\\nto earn large plums; but nothing of the sort could be expected from\\nunpractical heresies about the Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis. Merman\\'s reputation as a sober thinker, a safe writer, a\\nsound lawyer, was irretrievably injured: the distractions of controversy\\nhad caused him to neglect useful editorial connections, and indeed his\\ndwindling care for miscellaneous subjects made his contributions too\\ndull to be desirable. Even if he could now have given a new turn to his\\nconcentration, and applied his talents so as to be ready to show himself\\nan exceptionally qualified lawyer, he would only have been like an\\narchitect in competition, too late with his superior plans; he would not\\nhave had an opportunity of showing his qualification. The small capital which had filled up deficiencies of\\nincome was almost exhausted, and Julia, in the effort to make supplies\\nequal to wants, had to use much ingenuity in diminishing the wants. The\\nbrave and affectionate woman whose small outline, so unimpressive\\nagainst an illuminated background, held within it a good share of\\nfeminine heroism, did her best to keep up the charm of home and soothe\\nher husband\\'s excitement; parting with the best jewel among her wedding\\npresents in order to pay rent, without ever hinting to her husband that\\nthis sad result had come of his undertaking to convince people who only\\nlaughed at him. She was a resigned little creature, and reflected that\\nsome husbands took to drinking and others to forgery: hers had only\\ntaken to the Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis, and was not unkind--only a\\nlittle more indifferent to her and the two children than she had ever\\nexpected he would be, his mind being eaten up with \"subjects,\" and\\nconstantly a little angry, not with her, but with everybody else,\\nespecially those who were celebrated. Merman felt himself ill-used by the world, and\\nthought very much worse of the world in consequence. The gall of his\\nadversaries\\' ink had been sucked into his system and ran in his blood. He was still in the prime of life, but his mind was aged by that eager\\nmonotonous construction which comes of feverish excitement on a single\\ntopic and uses up the intellectual strength. Merman had never been a rich man, but he was now conspicuously poor, and\\nin need of the friends who had power or interest which he believed they\\ncould exert on his behalf. Their omitting or declining to give this help\\ncould not seem to him so clearly as to them an inevitable consequence of\\nhis having become impracticable, or at least of his passing for a man\\nwhose views were not likely to be safe and sober. Each friend in turn\\noffended him, though unwillingly, and was suspected of wishing to shake\\nhim off. It was not altogether so; but poor Merman\\'s society had\\nundeniably ceased to be attractive, and it was difficult to help him. At\\nlast the pressure of want urged him to try for a post far beneath his\\nearlier prospects, and he gained it. He holds it still, for he has no\\nvices, and his domestic life has kept up a sweetening current of motive\\naround and within him. Nevertheless, the bitter flavour mingling itself\\nwith all topics, the premature weariness and withering, are irrevocably\\nthere. It is as if he had gone through a disease which alters what we\\ncall the constitution. He has long ceased to talk eagerly of the ideas\\nwhich possess him, or to attempt making proselytes. The dial has moved\\nonward, and he himself sees many of his former guesses in a new light. On the other hand, he has seen what he foreboded, that the main idea\\nwhich was at the root of his too rash theorising has been adopted by\\nGrampus and received with general respect, no reference being heard to\\nthe ridiculous figure this important conception made when ushered in by\\nthe incompetent \"Others.\" Now and then, on rare occasions, when a sympathetic _tete-a-tete_ has\\nrestored some of his old expansiveness, he will tell a companion in a\\nrailway carriage, or other place of meeting favourable to\\nautobiographical confidences, what has been the course of things in his\\nparticular case, as an example of the justice to be expected of the\\nworld. The companion usually allows for the bitterness of a disappointed\\nman, and is secretly disinclined to believe that Grampus was to blame. A MAN SURPRISED AT HIS ORIGINALITY. Among the many acute sayings of La Rochefoucauld, there is hardly one\\nmore acute than this: \"La plus grande ambition n\\'en a pas la moindre\\napparence lorsqu\\'elle se rencontre dans une impossibilite absolue\\nd\\'arriver ou elle aspire.\" Some of us might do well to use this hint in\\nour treatment of acquaintances and friends from whom we are expecting\\ngratitude because we are so very kind in thinking of them, inviting\\nthem, and even listening to what they say--considering how insignificant\\nthey must feel themselves to be. We are often fallaciously confident in\\nsupposing that our friend\\'s state of mind is appropriate to our moderate\\nestimate of his importance: almost as if we imagined the humble mollusc\\n(so useful as an illustration) to have a sense of his own exceeding\\nsoftness and low place in the scale of being. Your mollusc, on the\\ncontrary, is inwardly objecting to every other grade of solid rather\\nthan to himself. Accustomed to observe what we think an unwarrantable\\nconceit exhibiting itself in ridiculous pretensions and forwardness to\\nplay the lion\\'s part, in obvious self-complacency and loud\\nperemptoriness, we are not on the alert to detect the egoistic claims of\\na more exorbitant kind often hidden under an apparent neutrality or an\\nacquiescence in being put out of the question. Thoughts of this kind occurred to me yesterday when I saw the name of\\nLentulus in the obituary. The majority of his acquaintances, I imagine,\\nhave always thought of him as a man justly unpretending and as nobody\\'s\\nrival; but some of them have perhaps been struck with surprise at his\\nreserve in praising the works of his contemporaries, and have now and\\nthen felt themselves in need of a key to his remarks on men of celebrity\\nin various departments. He was a man of fair position, deriving his\\nincome from a business in which he did nothing, at leisure to frequent\\nclubs and at ease in giving dinners; well-looking, polite, and generally\\nacceptable in society as a part of what we may call its bread-crumb--the\\nneutral basis needful for the plums and spice. Why, then, did he speak\\nof the modern Maro or the modern Flaccus with a peculiarity in his tone\\nof assent to other people\\'s praise which might almost have led you to\\nsuppose that the eminent poet had borrowed money of him and showed an\\nindisposition to repay? He had no criticism to offer, no sign of\\nobjection more specific than a slight cough, a scarcely perceptible\\npause before assenting, and an air of self-control in his utterance--as\\nif certain considerations had determined him not to inform against the\\nso-called poet, who to his knowledge was a mere versifier. If you had\\nquestioned him closely, he would perhaps have confessed that he did\\nthink something better might be done in the way of Eclogues and\\nGeorgics, or of Odes and Epodes, and that to his mind poetry was\\nsomething very different from what had hitherto been known under that\\nname. For my own part, being of a superstitious nature, given readily to\\nimagine alarming causes, I immediately, on first getting these mystic\\nhints from Lentulus, concluded that he held a number of entirely\\noriginal poems, or at the very least a revolutionary treatise on\\npoetics, in that melancholy manuscript state to which works excelling\\nall that is ever printed are necessarily condemned; and I was long timid\\nin speaking of the poets when he was present. For what might not\\nLentulus have done, or be profoundly aware of, that would make my\\nignorant impressions ridiculous? One cannot well be sure of the negative\\nin such a case, except through certain positives that bear witness to\\nit; and those witnesses are not always to be got hold of. But time\\nwearing on, I perceived that the attitude of Lentulus towards the\\nphilosophers was essentially the same as his attitude towards the poets;\\nnay, there was something so much more decided in his mode of closing his\\nmouth after brief speech on the former, there was such an air of rapt\\nconsciousness in his private hints as to his conviction that all\\nthinking hitherto had been an elaborate mistake, and as to his own\\npower of conceiving a sound basis for a lasting superstructure, that I\\nbegan to believe less in the poetical stores, and to infer that the line\\nof Lentulus lay rather in the rational criticism of our beliefs and in\\nsystematic construction. In this case I did not figure to myself the\\nexistence of formidable manuscripts ready for the press; for great\\nthinkers are known to carry their theories growing within their minds\\nlong before committing them to paper, and the ideas which made a new\\npassion for them when their locks were jet or auburn, remain perilously\\nunwritten, an inwardly developing condition of their successive selves,\\nuntil the locks are grey or scanty. I only meditated improvingly on the\\nway in which a man of exceptional faculties, and even carrying within\\nhim some of that fierce refiner\\'s fire which is to purge away the dross\\nof human error, may move about in society totally unrecognised, regarded\\nas a person whose opinion is superfluous, and only rising into a power\\nin emergencies of threatened black-balling. Imagine a Descartes or a\\nLocke being recognised for nothing more than a good fellow and a\\nperfect gentleman--what a painful view does such a picture suggest of\\nimpenetrable dulness in the society around them! I would at all times rather be reduced to a cheaper estimate of a\\nparticular person, if by that means I can get a more cheerful view of my\\nfellow-men generally; and I confess that in a certain curiosity which\\nled me to cultivate Lentulus\\'s acquaintance, my hope leaned to the\\ndiscovery that he was a less remarkable man than he had seemed to imply. It would have been a grief to discover that he was bitter or malicious,\\nbut by finding him to be neither a mighty poet, nor a revolutionary\\npoetical critic, nor an epoch-making philosopher, my admiration for the\\npoets and thinkers whom he rated so low would recover all its buoyancy,\\nand I should not be left to trust to that very suspicious sort of merit\\nwhich constitutes an exception in the history of mankind, and recommends\\nitself as the total abolitionist of all previous claims on our\\nconfidence. You are not greatly surprised at the infirm logic of the\\ncoachman who would persuade you to engage him by insisting that any\\nother would be sure to rob you in the matter of hay and corn, thus\\ndemanding a difficult belief in him as the sole exception from the\\nfrailties of his calling; but it is rather astonishing that the\\nwholesale decriers of mankind and its performances should be even more\\nunwary in their reasoning than the coachman, since each of them not\\nmerely confides in your regarding himself as an exception, but overlooks\\nthe almost certain fact that you are wondering whether he inwardly\\nexcepts _you_. Now, conscious of entertaining some common opinions which\\nseemed to fall under the mildly intimated but sweeping ban of Lentulus,\\nmy self-complacency was a little concerned. Hence I deliberately attempted to draw out Lentulus in private dialogue,\\nfor it is the reverse of injury to a man to offer him that hearing which\\nhe seems to have found nowhere else. And for whatever purposes silence\\nmay be equal to gold, it cannot be safely taken as an indication of\\nspecific ideas. I sought to know why Lentulus was more than indifferent\\nto the poets, and what was that new poetry which he had either written\\nor, as to its principles, distinctly conceived. But I presently found\\nthat he knew very little of any particular poet, and had a general\\nnotion of poetry as the use of artificial language to express unreal\\nsentiments: he instanced \"The Giaour,\" \"Lalla Rookh,\" \"The Pleasures of\\nHope,\" and \"Ruin seize thee, ruthless King;\" adding, \"and plenty more.\" On my observing that he probably preferred a larger, simpler style, he\\nemphatically assented. \"Have you not,\" said I, \"written something of\\nthat order?\" \"No; but I often compose as I go along. I see how things\\nmight be written as fine as Ossian, only with true ideas. The world has\\nno notion what poetry will be.\" It was impossible to disprove this, and I am always glad to believe that\\nthe poverty of our imagination is no measure of the world\\'s resources. Our posterity will no doubt get fuel in ways that we are unable to\\ndevise for them. But what this conversation persuaded me of was, that\\nthe birth with which the mind of Lentulus was pregnant could not be\\npoetry, though I did not question that he composed as he went along, and\\nthat the exercise was accompanied with a great sense of power. This is a\\nfrequent experience in dreams, and much of our waking experience is but\\na dream in the daylight. Nay, for what I saw, the compositions might be\\nfairly classed as Ossianic. But I was satisfied that Lentulus could not\\ndisturb my grateful admiration for the poets of all ages by eclipsing\\nthem, or by putting them under a new electric light of criticism. Still, he had himself thrown the chief emphasis of his protest and his\\nconsciousness of corrective illumination on the philosophic thinking of\\nour race; and his tone in assuring me that everything which had been\\ndone in that way was wrong--that Plato, Robert Owen, and Dr Tuffle who\\nwrote in the \\'Regulator,\\' were all equally mistaken--gave my\\nsuperstitious nature a thrill of anxiety. After what had passed about\\nthe poets, it did not seem likely that Lentulus had all systems by\\nheart; but who could say he had not seized that thread which may\\nsomewhere hang out loosely from the web of things and be the clue of\\nunravelment? We need not go far to learn that a prophet is not made by\\nerudition. Lentulus at least had not the bias of a school; and if it\\nturned out that he was in agreement with any celebrated thinker,\\nancient or modern, the agreement would have the value of an undesigned\\ncoincidence not due to forgotten reading. It was therefore with renewed\\ncuriosity that I engaged him on this large subject--the universal\\nerroneousness of thinking up to the period when Lentulus began that\\nprocess. And here I found him more copious than on the theme of poetry. He admitted that he did contemplate writing down his thoughts, but his\\ndifficulty was their abundance. Apparently he was like the woodcutter\\nentering the thick forest and saying, \"Where shall I begin?\" The same\\nobstacle appeared in a minor degree to cling about his verbal\\nexposition, and accounted perhaps for his rather helter-skelter choice\\nof remarks bearing on the number of unaddressed letters sent to the\\npost-office; on what logic really is, as tending to support the buoyancy\\nof human mediums and mahogany tables; on the probability of all miracles\\nunder all religions when explained by hidden laws, and my\\nunreasonableness in supposing that their profuse occurrence at half a\\nguinea an hour in recent times was anything more than a coincidence; on\\nthe haphazard way in which marriages are determined--showing the\\nbaselessness of social and moral schemes; and on his expectation that he\\nshould offend the scientific world when he told them what he thought of\\nelectricity as an agent. No man\\'s appearance could be graver or more gentleman-like than that of\\nLentulus as we walked along the Mall while he delivered these\\nobservations, understood by himself to have a regenerative bearing on\\nhuman society. His wristbands and black gloves, his hat and nicely\\nclipped hair, his laudable moderation in beard, and his evident\\ndiscrimination in choosing his tailor, all seemed to excuse the\\nprevalent estimate of him as a man untainted with heterodoxy, and likely\\nto be so unencumbered with opinions that he would always be useful as an\\nassenting and admiring listener. Men of science seeing him at their\\nlectures doubtless flattered themselves that he came to learn from them;\\nthe philosophic ornaments of our time, expounding some of their luminous\\nideas in the social circle, took the meditative gaze of Lentulus for one\\nof surprise not unmixed with a just reverence at such close reasoning\\ntowards so novel a conclusion; and those who are called men of the\\nworld considered him a good fellow who might be asked to vote for a\\nfriend of their own and would have no troublesome notions to make him\\nunaccommodating. You perceive how very much they were all mistaken,\\nexcept in qualifying him as a good fellow. This Lentulus certainly was, in the sense of being free from envy,\\nhatred, and malice; and such freedom was all the more remarkable an\\nindication of native benignity, because of his gaseous, illimitably\\nexpansive conceit. Yes, conceit; for that his enormous and contentedly\\nignorant confidence in his own rambling thoughts was usually clad in a\\ndecent silence, is no reason why it should be less strictly called by\\nthe name directly implying a complacent self-estimate unwarranted by\\nperformance. Nay, the total privacy in which he enjoyed his\\nconsciousness of inspiration was the very condition of its undisturbed\\nplacid nourishment and gigantic growth. Your audibly arrogant man\\nexposes himself to tests: in attempting to make an impression on others\\nhe may possibly (not always) be made to feel his own lack of\\ndefiniteness; and the demand for definiteness is to all of us a needful\\ncheck on vague depreciation of what others do, and vague ecstatic trust\\nin our own superior ability. But Lentulus was at once so unreceptive,\\nand so little gifted with the power of displaying his miscellaneous\\ndeficiency of information, that there was really nothing to hinder his\\nastonishment at the spontaneous crop of ideas which his mind secretly\\nyielded. If it occurred to him that there were more meanings than one\\nfor the word \"motive,\" since it sometimes meant the end aimed at and\\nsometimes the feeling that prompted the aiming, and that the word\\n\"cause\" was also of changeable import, he was naturally struck with the\\ntruth of his own perception, and was convinced that if this vein were\\nwell followed out much might be made of it. Men were evidently in the\\nwrong about cause and effect, else why was society in the confused state\\nwe behold? And as to motive, Lentulus felt that when he came to write\\ndown his views he should look deeply into this kind of subject and show\\nup thereby the anomalies of our social institutions; meanwhile the\\nvarious aspects of \"motive\" and \"cause\" flitted about among the motley\\ncrowd of ideas which he regarded as original, and pregnant with\\nreformative efficacy. For his unaffected goodwill made him regard all\\nhis insight as only valuable because it tended towards reform. The respectable man had got into his illusory maze of discoveries by\\nletting go that clue of conformity in his thinking which he had kept\\nfast hold of in his tailoring and manners. He regarded heterodoxy as a\\npower in itself, and took his inacquaintance with doctrines for a\\ncreative dissidence. But his epitaph needs not to be a melancholy one. His benevolent disposition was more effective for good than his silent\\npresumption for harm. He might have been mischievous but for the lack of\\nwords: instead of being astonished at his inspirations in private, he\\nmight have clad his addled originalities, disjointed commonplaces, blind\\ndenials, and balloon-like conclusions, in that mighty sort of language\\nwhich would have made a new Koran for a knot of followers. I mean no\\ndisrespect to the ancient Koran, but one would not desire the roc to lay\\nmore eggs and give us a whole wing-flapping brood to soar and make\\ntwilight. Peace be with Lentulus, for he has left us in peace. Blessed is the man\\nwho, having nothing to say, abstains from giving us wordy evidence of\\nthe fact--from calling on us to look through a heap of millet-seed in\\norder to be sure that there is no pearl in it. V.\\n\\n\\nA TOO DEFERENTIAL MAN. A little unpremeditated insincerity must be indulged under the stress of\\nsocial intercourse. The talk even of an honest man must often represent\\nmerely his wish to be inoffensive or agreeable rather than his genuine\\nopinion or feeling on the matter in hand. His thought, if uttered, might\\nbe wounding; or he has not the ability to utter it with exactness and\\nsnatches at a loose paraphrase; or he has really no genuine thought on\\nthe question and is driven to fill up the vacancy by borrowing the\\nremarks in vogue. These are the winds and currents we have all to steer\\namongst, and they are often too strong for our truthfulness or our wit. Let us not bear too hardly on each other for this common incidental\\nfrailty, or think that we rise superior to it by dropping all\\nconsiderateness and deference. But there are studious, deliberate forms of insincerity which it is fair\\nto be impatient with: Hinze\\'s, for example. From his name you might\\nsuppose him to be German: in fact, his family is Alsatian, but has been\\nsettled in England for more than one generation. He is the superlatively\\ndeferential man, and walks about with murmured wonder at the wisdom and\\ndiscernment of everybody who talks to him. He cultivates the low-toned\\n_tete-a-tete,_ keeping his hat carefully in his hand and often stroking\\nit, while he smiles with downcast eyes, as if to relieve his feelings\\nunder the pressure of the remarkable conversation which it is his honour\\nto enjoy at the present moment. I confess to some rage on hearing him\\nyesterday talking to Felicia, who is certainly a clever woman, and,\\nwithout any unusual desire to show her cleverness, occasionally says\\nsomething of her own or makes an allusion which is not quite common. Still, it must happen to her as to every one else to speak of many\\nsubjects on which the best things were said long ago, and in\\nconversation with a person who has been newly introduced those\\nwell-worn themes naturally recur as a further development of salutations\\nand preliminary media of understanding, such as pipes, chocolate, or\\nmastic-chewing, which serve to confirm the impression that our new\\nacquaintance is on a civilised footing and has enough regard for\\nformulas to save us from shocking outbursts of individualism, to which\\nwe are always exposed with the tamest bear or baboon. Considered purely\\nas a matter of information, it cannot any longer be important for us to\\nlearn that a British subject included in the last census holds Shakspere\\nto be supreme in the presentation of character; still, it is as\\nadmissible for any one to make this statement about himself as to rub\\nhis hands and tell you that the air is brisk, if only he will let it\\nfall as a matter of course, with a parenthetic lightness, and not\\nannounce his adhesion to a commonplace with an emphatic insistance, as\\nif it were a proof of singular insight. We mortals should chiefly like\\nto talk to each other out of goodwill and fellowship, not for the sake\\nof hearing revelations or being stimulated by witticisms; and I have\\nusually found that it is the rather dull person who appears to be\\ndisgusted with his contemporaries because they are not always strikingly\\noriginal, and to satisfy whom the party at a country house should have\\nincluded the prophet Isaiah, Plato, Francis Bacon, and Voltaire. It is\\nalways your heaviest bore who is astonished at the tameness of modern\\ncelebrities: naturally; for a little of his company has reduced them to\\na state of flaccid fatigue. It is right and meet that there should be an\\nabundant utterance of good sound commonplaces. Part of an agreeable\\ntalker\\'s charm is that he lets them fall continually with no more than\\ntheir due emphasis. Giving a pleasant voice to what we are all well\\nassured of, makes a sort of wholesome air for more special and dubious\\nremark to move in. Hence it seemed to me far from unbecoming in Felicia that in her first\\ndialogue with Hinze, previously quite a stranger to her, her\\nobservations were those of an ordinarily refined and well-educated woman\\non standard subjects, and might have been printed in a manual of polite\\ntopics and creditable opinions. She had no desire to astonish a man of\\nwhom she had heard nothing particular. It was all the more exasperating\\nto see and hear Hinze\\'s reception of her well-bred conformities. Felicia\\'s acquaintances know her as the suitable wife of a distinguished\\nman, a sensible, vivacious, kindly-disposed woman, helping her husband\\nwith graceful apologies written and spoken, and making her receptions\\nagreeable to all comers. But you would have imagined that Hinze had been\\nprepared by general report to regard this introduction to her as an\\nopportunity comparable to an audience of the Delphic Sibyl. When she had\\ndelivered herself on the changes in Italian travel, on the difficulty of\\nreading Ariosto in these busy times, on the want of equilibrium in\\nFrench political affairs, and on the pre-eminence of German music, he\\nwould know what to think. Felicia was evidently embarrassed by his\\nreverent wonder, and, in dread lest she should seem to be playing the\\noracle, became somewhat confused, stumbling on her answers rather than\\nchoosing them. But this made no difference to Hinze\\'s rapt attention and\\nsubdued eagerness of inquiry. He continued to put large questions,\\nbending his head slightly that his eyes might be a little lifted in\\nawaiting her reply. \"What, may I ask, is your opinion as to the state of Art in England?\" \"Oh,\" said Felicia, with a light deprecatory laugh, \"I think it suffers\\nfrom two diseases--bad taste in the patrons and want of inspiration in\\nthe artists.\" \"That is true indeed,\" said Hinze, in an undertone of deep conviction. \"You have put your finger with strict accuracy on the causes of decline. To a cultivated taste like yours this must be particularly painful.\" \"I did not say there was actual decline,\" said Felicia, with a touch of\\n_brusquerie_. \"I don\\'t set myself up as the great personage whom nothing\\ncan please.\" \"That would be too severe a misfortune for others,\" says my\\ncomplimentary ape. \"You approve, perhaps, of Rosemary\\'s \\'Babes in the\\nWood,\\' as something fresh and _naive_ in sculpture?\" Or _will_ you permit me to tell him?\" It would be an impertinence in me to praise a work of\\nhis--to pronounce on its quality; and that I happen to like it can be of\\nno consequence to him.\" Here was an occasion for Hinze to smile down on his hat and stroke\\nit--Felicia\\'s ignorance that her praise was inestimable being peculiarly\\nnoteworthy to an observer of mankind. Presently he was quite sure that\\nher favourite author was Shakspere, and wished to know what she thought\\nof Hamlet\\'s madness. When she had quoted Wilhelm Meister on this point,\\nand had afterwards testified that \"Lear\" was beyond adequate\\npresentation, that \"Julius Caesar\" was an effective acting play, and\\nthat a poet may know a good deal about human nature while knowing little\\nof geography, Hinze appeared so impressed with the plenitude of these\\nrevelations that he recapitulated them, weaving them together with\\nthreads of compliment--\"As you very justly observed;\" and--\"It is most\\ntrue, as you say;\" and--\"It were well if others noted what you have\\nremarked.\" Some listeners incautious in their epithets would have called Hinze an\\n\"ass.\" For my part I would never insult that intelligent and\\nunpretending animal who no doubt brays with perfect simplicity and\\nsubstantial meaning to those acquainted with his idiom, and if he feigns\\nmore submission than he feels, has weighty reasons for doing so--I would\\nnever, I say, insult that historic and ill-appreciated animal, the ass,\\nby giving his name to a man whose continuous pretence is so shallow in\\nits motive, so unexcused by any sharp appetite as this of Hinze\\'s. But perhaps you would say that his adulatory manner was originally\\nadopted under strong promptings of self-interest, and that his absurdly\\nover-acted deference to persons from whom he expects no patronage is the\\nunreflecting persistence of habit--just as those who live with the deaf\\nwill shout to everybody else. And you might indeed imagine that in talking to Tulpian, who has\\nconsiderable interest at his disposal, Hinze had a desired appointment\\nin his mind. Tulpian is appealed to on innumerable subjects, and if he\\nis unwilling to express himself on any one of them, says so with\\ninstructive copiousness: he is much listened to, and his utterances are\\nregistered and reported with more or less exactitude. But I think he\\nhas no other listener who comports himself as Hinze does--who,\\nfiguratively speaking, carries about a small spoon ready to pick up any\\ndusty crumb of opinion that the eloquent man may have let drop. Tulpian,\\nwith reverence be it said, has some rather absurd notions, such as a\\nmind of large discourse often finds room for: they slip about among his\\nhigher conceptions and multitudinous acquirements like disreputable\\ncharacters at a national celebration in some vast cathedral, where to\\nthe ardent soul all is glorified by rainbow light and grand\\nassociations: any vulgar detective knows them for what they are. But\\nHinze is especially fervid in his desire to hear Tulpian dilate on his\\ncrotchets, and is rather troublesome to bystanders in asking them\\nwhether they have read the various fugitive writings in which these\\ncrotchets have been published. If an expert is explaining some matter on\\nwhich you desire to know the evidence, Hinze teases you with Tulpian\\'s\\nguesses, and asks the expert what he thinks of them. In general, Hinze delights in the citation of opinions, and would\\nhardly remark that the sun shone without an air of respectful appeal or\\nfervid adhesion. The \\'Iliad,\\' one sees, would impress him little if it\\nwere not for what Mr Fugleman has lately said about it; and if you\\nmention an image or sentiment in Chaucer he seems not to heed the\\nbearing of your reference, but immediately tells you that Mr Hautboy,\\ntoo, regards Chaucer as a poet of the first order, and he is delighted\\nto find that two such judges as you and Hautboy are at one. What is the reason of all this subdued ecstasy, moving about, hat in\\nhand, with well-dressed hair and attitudes of unimpeachable correctness? Some persons conscious of sagacity decide at once that Hinze knows what\\nhe is about in flattering Tulpian, and has a carefully appraised end to\\nserve though they may not see it They are misled by the common mistake\\nof supposing that men\\'s behaviour, whether habitual or occasional, is\\nchiefly determined by a distinctly conceived motive, a definite object\\nto be gained or a definite evil to be avoided. The truth is, that, the\\nprimitive wants of nature once tolerably satisfied, the majority of\\nmankind, even in a civilised life full of solicitations, are with\\ndifficulty aroused to the distinct conception of an object towards which\\nthey will direct their actions with careful adaptation, and it is yet\\nrarer to find one who can persist in the systematic pursuit of such an\\nend. Few lives are shaped, few characters formed, by the contemplation\\nof definite consequences seen from a distance and made the goal of\\ncontinuous effort or the beacon of a constantly avoided danger: such\\ncontrol by foresight, such vivid picturing and practical logic are the\\ndistinction of exceptionally strong natures; but society is chiefly made\\nup of human beings whose daily acts are all performed either in\\nunreflecting obedience to custom and routine or from immediate\\npromptings of thought or feeling to execute an immediate purpose. They\\npay their poor-rates, give their vote in affairs political or parochial,\\nwear a certain amount of starch, hinder boys from tormenting the\\nhelpless, and spend money on tedious observances called pleasures,\\nwithout mentally adjusting these practices to their own well-understood\\ninterest or to the general, ultimate welfare of the human race; and when\\nthey fall into ungraceful compliment, excessive smiling or other\\nluckless efforts of complaisant behaviour, these are but the tricks or\\nhabits gradually formed under the successive promptings of a wish to be\\nagreeable, stimulated day by day without any widening resources for\\ngratifying the wish. It does not in the least follow that they are\\nseeking by studied hypocrisy to get something for themselves. And so\\nwith Hinze\\'s deferential bearing, complimentary parentheses, and\\nworshipful tones, which seem to some like the over-acting of a part in a\\ncomedy. He expects no appointment or other appreciable gain through\\nTulpian\\'s favour; he has no doubleness towards Felicia; there is no\\nsneering or backbiting obverse to his ecstatic admiration. He is very\\nwell off in the world, and cherishes no unsatisfied ambition that could\\nfeed design and direct flattery. As you perceive, he has had the\\neducation and other advantages of a gentleman without being conscious of\\nmarked result, such as a decided preference for any particular ideas or\\nfunctions: his mind is furnished as hotels are, with everything for\\noccasional and transient use. But one cannot be an Englishman and\\ngentleman in general: it is in the nature of things that one must have\\nan individuality, though it may be of an often-repeated type. As Hinze\\nin growing to maturity had grown into a particular form and expression\\nof person, so he necessarily gathered a manner and frame of speech which\\nmade him additionally recognisable. His nature is not tuned to the pitch\\nof a genuine direct admiration, only to an attitudinising deference\\nwhich does not fatigue itself with the formation of real judgments. All\\nhuman achievement must be wrought down to this spoon-meat--this mixture\\nof other persons\\' washy opinions and his own flux of reverence for what\\nis third-hand, before Hinze can find a relish for it. He has no more leading characteristic than the desire to stand well with\\nthose who are justly distinguished; he has no base admirations, and you\\nmay know by his entire presentation of himself, from the management of\\nhis hat to the angle at which he keeps his right foot, that he aspires\\nto correctness. Desiring to behave becomingly and also to make a figure\\nin dialogue, he is only like the bad artist whose picture is a failure. We may pity these ill-gifted strivers, but not pretend that their works\\nare pleasant to behold. A man is bound to know something of his own\\nweight and muscular dexterity, and the puny athlete is called foolish\\nbefore he is seen to be thrown. Hinze has not the stuff in him to be at\\nonce agreeably conversational and sincere, and he has got himself up to\\nbe at all events agreeably conversational. Notwithstanding this\\ndeliberateness of intention in his talk he is unconscious of falsity,\\nfor he has not enough of deep and lasting impression to find a contrast\\nor diversity between his words and his thoughts. He is not fairly to be\\ncalled a hypocrite, but I have already confessed to the more\\nexasperation at his make-believe reverence, because it has no deep\\nhunger to excuse it. Its primary meaning, the proportion and mode in which\\nqualities are mingled, is much neglected in popular speech, yet even\\nhere the word often carries a reference to an habitual state or general\\ntendency of the organism in distinction from what are held to be\\nspecific virtues and vices. As people confess to bad memory without\\nexpecting to sink in mental reputation, so we hear a man declared to\\nhave a bad temper and yet glorified as the possessor of every high\\nquality. When he errs or in any way commits himself, his temper is\\naccused, not his character, and it is understood that but for a brutal\\nbearish mood he is kindness itself. If he kicks small animals, swears\\nviolently at a servant who mistakes orders, or is grossly rude to his\\nwife, it is remarked apologetically that these things mean nothing--they\\nare all temper. Certainly there is a limit to this form of apology, and the forgery of a\\nbill, or the ordering of goods without any prospect of paying for them,\\nhas never been set down to an unfortunate habit of sulkiness or of\\nirascibility. But on the whole there is a peculiar exercise of\\nindulgence towards the manifestations of bad temper which tends to\\nencourage them, so that we are in danger of having among us a number of\\nvirtuous persons who conduct themselves detestably, just as we have\\nhysterical patients who, with sound organs, are apparently labouring\\nunder many sorts of organic disease. Let it be admitted, however, that a\\nman may be \"a good fellow\" and yet have a bad temper, so bad that we\\nrecognise his merits with reluctance, and are inclined to resent his\\noccasionally amiable behaviour as an unfair demand on our admiration. He is by turns insolent,\\nquarrelsome, repulsively haughty to innocent people who approach him\\nwith respect, neglectful of his friends, angry in face of legitimate\\ndemands, procrastinating in the fulfilment of such demands, prompted to\\nrude words and harsh looks by a moody disgust with his fellow-men in\\ngeneral--and yet, as everybody will assure you, the soul of honour, a\\nsteadfast friend, a defender of the oppressed, an affectionate-hearted\\ncreature. Pity that, after a certain experience of his moods, his\\nintimacy becomes insupportable! A man who uses his balmorals to tread on\\nyour toes with much frequency and an unmistakeable emphasis may prove a\\nfast friend in adversity, but meanwhile your adversity has not arrived\\nand your toes are tender. The daily sneer or growl at your remarks is\\nnot to be made amends for by a possible eulogy or defence of your\\nunderstanding against depredators who may not present themselves, and on\\nan occasion which may never arise. I cannot submit to a chronic state of\\nblue and green bruise as a form of insurance against an accident. Touchwood\\'s bad temper is of the contradicting pugnacious sort. He is\\nthe honourable gentleman in opposition, whatever proposal or proposition\\nmay be broached, and when others join him he secretly damns their\\nsuperfluous agreement, quickly discovering that his way of stating the\\ncase is not exactly theirs. An invitation or any sign of expectation\\nthrows him into an attitude of refusal. Ask his concurrence in a\\nbenevolent measure: he will not decline to give it, because he has a\\nreal sympathy with good aims; but he complies resentfully, though where\\nhe is let alone he will do much more than any one would have thought of\\nasking for. No man would shrink with greater sensitiveness from the\\nimputation of not paying his debts, yet when a bill is sent in with any\\npromptitude he is inclined to make the tradesman wait for the money he\\nis in such a hurry to get. One sees that this antagonistic temper must\\nbe much relieved by finding a particular object, and that its worst\\nmoments must be those where the mood is that of vague resistance, there\\nbeing nothing specific to oppose. Touchwood is never so little engaging\\nas when he comes down to breakfast with a cloud on his brow, after\\nparting from you the night before with an affectionate effusiveness at\\nthe end of a confidential conversation which has assured you of mutual\\nunderstanding. If\\nmice have disturbed him, that is not your fault; but, nevertheless, your\\ncheerful greeting had better not convey any reference to the weather,\\nelse it will be met by a sneer which, taking you unawares, may give you\\na crushing sense that you make a poor figure with your cheerfulness,\\nwhich was not asked for. Some daring person perhaps introduces another\\ntopic, and uses the delicate flattery of appealing to Touchwood for his\\nopinion, the topic being included in his favourite studies. An\\nindistinct muttering, with a look at the carving-knife in reply, teaches\\nthat daring person how ill he has chosen a market for his deference. If\\nTouchwood\\'s behaviour affects you very closely you had better break your\\nleg in the course of the day: his bad temper will then vanish at once;\\nhe will take a painful journey on your behalf; he will sit up with you\\nnight after night; he will do all the work of your department so as to\\nsave you from any loss in consequence of your accident; he will be even\\nuniformly tender to you till you are well on your legs again, when he\\nwill some fine morning insult you without provocation, and make you wish\\nthat his generous goodness to you had not closed your lips against\\nretort. It is not always necessary that a friend should break his leg for\\nTouchwood to feel compunction and endeavour to make amends for his\\nbearishness or insolence. He becomes spontaneously conscious that he has\\nmisbehaved, and he is not only ashamed of himself, but has the better\\nprompting to try and heal any wound he has inflicted. Unhappily the\\nhabit of being offensive \"without meaning it\" leads usually to a way of\\nmaking amends which the injured person cannot but regard as a being\\namiable without meaning it. The kindnesses, the complimentary\\nindications or assurances, are apt to appear in the light of a penance\\nadjusted to the foregoing lapses, and by the very contrast they offer\\ncall up a keener memory of the wrong they atone for. They are not a\\nspontaneous prompting of goodwill, but an elaborate compensation. And,\\nin fact, Dion\\'s atoning friendliness has a ring of artificiality. Because he formerly disguised his good feeling towards you he now\\nexpresses more than he quite feels. Having made you\\nextremely uncomfortable last week he has absolutely diminished his\\npower of making you happy to-day: he struggles against this result by\\nexcessive effort, but he has taught you to observe his fitfulness rather\\nthan to be warmed by his episodic show of regard. I suspect that many persons who have an uncertain, incalculable temper\\nflatter themselves that it enhances their fascination; but perhaps they\\nare under the prior mistake of exaggerating the charm which they suppose\\nto be thus strengthened; in any case they will do well not to trust in\\nthe attractions of caprice and moodiness for a long continuance or for\\nclose intercourse. A pretty woman may fan the flame of distant adorers\\nby harassing them, but if she lets one of them make her his wife, the\\npoint of view from which he will look at her poutings and tossings and\\nmysterious inability to be pleased will be seriously altered. And if\\nslavery to a pretty woman, which seems among the least conditional forms\\nof abject service, will not bear too great a strain from her bad temper\\neven though her beauty remain the same, it is clear that a man whose\\nclaims lie in his high character or high performances had need impress\\nus very constantly with his peculiar value and indispensableness, if he\\nis to test our patience by an uncertainty of temper which leaves us\\nabsolutely without grounds for guessing how he will receive our persons\\nor humbly advanced opinions, or what line he will take on any but the\\nmost momentous occasions. For it is among the repulsive effects of this bad temper, which is\\nsupposed to be compatible with shining virtues, that it is apt to\\ndetermine a man\\'s sudden adhesion to an opinion, whether on a personal\\nor impersonal matter, without leaving him time to consider his grounds. The adhesion is sudden and momentary, but it either forms a precedent\\nfor his line of thought and action, or it is presently seen to have been\\ninconsistent with his true mind. This determination of partisanship by\\ntemper has its worst effects in the career of the public man, who is\\nalways in danger of getting so enthralled by his own words that he looks\\ninto facts and questions not to get rectifying knowledge, but to get\\nevidence that will justify his actual attitude which was assumed under\\nan impulse dependent on something else than knowledge. There has been\\nplenty of insistance on the evil of swearing by the words of a master,\\nand having the judgment uniformly controlled by a \"He said it;\" but a\\nmuch worse woe to befall a man is to have every judgment controlled by\\nan \"I said it\"--to make a divinity of his own short-sightedness or\\npassion-led aberration and explain the world in its honour. There is\\nhardly a more pitiable degradation than this for a man of high gifts. Hence I cannot join with those who wish that Touchwood, being young\\nenough to enter on public life, should get elected for Parliament and\\nuse his excellent abilities to serve his country in that conspicuous\\nmanner. For hitherto, in the less momentous incidents of private life,\\nhis capricious temper has only produced the minor evil of inconsistency,\\nand he is even greatly at ease in contradicting himself, provided he can\\ncontradict you, and disappoint any smiling expectation you may have\\nshown that the impressions you are uttering are likely to meet with his\\nsympathy, considering that the day before he himself gave you the\\nexample which your mind is following. He is at least free from those\\nfetters of self-justification which are the curse of parliamentary\\nspeaking, and what I rather desire for him is that he should produce the\\ngreat book which he is generally pronounced capable of writing, and put\\nhis best self imperturbably on record for the advantage of society;\\nbecause I should then have steady ground for bearing with his diurnal\\nincalculableness, and could fix my gratitude as by a strong staple to\\nthat unvarying monumental service. Unhappily, Touchwood\\'s great powers\\nhave been only so far manifested as to be believed in, not demonstrated. Everybody rates them highly, and thinks that whatever he chose to do\\nwould be done in a first-rate manner. Is it his love of disappointing\\ncomplacent expectancy which has gone so far as to keep up this\\nlamentable negation, and made him resolve not to write the comprehensive\\nwork which he would have written if nobody had expected it of him? One can see that if Touchwood were to become a public man and take to\\nfrequent speaking on platforms or from his seat in the House, it would\\nhardly be possible for him to maintain much integrity of opinion, or to\\navoid courses of partisanship which a healthy public sentiment would\\nstamp with discredit. Say that he were endowed with the purest honesty,\\nit would inevitably be dragged captive by this mysterious, Protean bad\\ntemper. There would be the fatal public necessity of justifying\\noratorical Temper which had got on its legs in its bitter mood and made\\ninsulting imputations, or of keeping up some decent show of consistency\\nwith opinions vented out of Temper\\'s contradictoriness. And words would\\nhave to be followed up by acts of adhesion. Certainly if a bad-tempered man can be admirably virtuous, he must be so\\nunder extreme difficulties. I doubt the possibility that a high order of\\ncharacter can coexist with a temper like Touchwood\\'s. For it is of the\\nnature of such temper to interrupt the formation of healthy mental\\nhabits, which depend on a growing harmony between perception,\\nconviction, and impulse. There may be good feelings, good deeds--for a\\nhuman nature may pack endless varieties and blessed inconsistencies in\\nits windings--but it is essential to what is worthy to be called high\\ncharacter, that it may be safely calculated on, and that its qualities\\nshall have taken the form of principles or laws habitually, if not\\nperfectly, obeyed. If a man frequently passes unjust judgments, takes up false attitudes,\\nintermits his acts of kindness with rude behaviour or cruel words, and\\nfalls into the consequent vulgar error of supposing that he can make\\namends by laboured agreeableness, I cannot consider such courses any the\\nless ugly because they are ascribed to \"temper.\" Especially I object to\\nthe assumption that his having a fundamentally good disposition is\\neither an apology or a compensation for his bad behaviour. If his temper\\nyesterday made him lash the horses, upset the curricle and cause a\\nbreakage in my rib, I feel it no compensation that to-day he vows he\\nwill drive me anywhere in the gentlest manner any day as long as he\\nlives. Yesterday was what it was, my rib is paining me, it is not a main\\nobject of my life to be driven by Touchwood--and I have no confidence in\\nhis lifelong gentleness. The utmost form of placability I am capable of\\nis to try and remember his better deeds already performed, and, mindful\\nof my own offences, to bear him no malice. If the bad-tempered man wants to apologise he had need to do it on a\\nlarge public scale, make some beneficent discovery, produce some\\nstimulating work of genius, invent some powerful process--prove himself\\nsuch a good to contemporary multitudes and future generations, as to\\nmake the discomfort he causes his friends and acquaintances a vanishing\\nquality, a trifle even in their own estimate. The most arrant denier must admit that a man often furthers larger ends\\nthan he is conscious of, and that while he is transacting his particular\\naffairs with the narrow pertinacity of a respectable ant, he subserves\\nan economy larger than any purpose of his own. Society is happily not\\ndependent for the growth of fellowship on the small minority already\\nendowed with comprehensive sympathy: any molecule of the body politic\\nworking towards his own interest in an orderly way gets his\\nunderstanding more or less penetrated with the fact that his interest is\\nincluded in that of a large number. I have watched several political\\nmolecules being educated in this way by the nature of things into a\\nfaint feeling of fraternity. But at this moment I am thinking of Spike,\\nan elector who voted on the side of Progress though he was not inwardly\\nattached to it under that name. For abstractions are deities having many\\nspecific names, local habitations, and forms of activity, and so get a\\nmultitude of devout servants who care no more for them under their\\nhighest titles than the celebrated person who, putting with forcible\\nbrevity a view of human motives now much insisted on, asked what\\nPosterity had done for him that he should care for Posterity? To many\\nminds even among the ancients (thought by some to have been invariably\\npoetical) the goddess of wisdom was doubtless worshipped simply as the\\npatroness of spinning and weaving. Now spinning and weaving from a\\nmanufacturing, wholesale point of view, was the chief form under which\\nSpike from early years had unconsciously been a devotee of Progress. He was a political molecule of the most gentleman-like appearance, not\\nless than six feet high, and showing the utmost nicety in the care of\\nhis person and equipment. His umbrella was especially remarkable for its\\nneatness, though perhaps he swung it unduly in walking. His complexion\\nwas fresh, his eyes small, bright, and twinkling. He was seen to great\\nadvantage in a hat and greatcoat--garments frequently fatal to the\\nimpressiveness of shorter figures; but when he was uncovered in the\\ndrawing-room, it was impossible not to observe that his head shelved off\\ntoo rapidly from the eyebrows towards the crown, and that his length of\\nlimb seemed to have used up his mind so as to cause an air of\\nabstraction from conversational topics. He appeared, indeed, to be\\npreoccupied with a sense of his exquisite cleanliness, clapped his hands\\ntogether and rubbed them frequently, straightened his back, and even\\nopened his mouth and closed it again with a slight snap, apparently for\\nno other purpose than the confirmation to himself of his own powers in\\nthat line. These are innocent exercises, but they are not such as give\\nweight to a man\\'s personality. Sometimes Spike\\'s mind, emerging from its\\npreoccupation, burst forth in a remark delivered with smiling zest; as,\\nthat he did like to see gravel walks well rolled, or that a lady should\\nalways wear the best jewellery, or that a bride was a most interesting\\nobject; but finding these ideas received rather coldly, he would relapse\\ninto abstraction, draw up his back, wrinkle his brows longitudinally,\\nand seem to regard society, even including gravel walks, jewellery, and\\nbrides, as essentially a poor affair. Indeed his habit of mind was\\ndesponding, and he took melancholy views as to the possible extent of\\nhuman pleasure and the value of existence. Especially after he had made\\nhis fortune in the cotton manufacture, and had thus attained the chief\\nobject of his ambition--the object which had engaged his talent for\\norder and persevering application. For his easy leisure caused him much\\n_ennui_. He was abstemious, and had none of those temptations to sensual\\nexcess which fill up a man\\'s time first with indulgence and then with\\nthe process of getting well from its effects. He had not, indeed,\\nexhausted the sources of knowledge, but here again his notions of human\\npleasure were narrowed by his want of appetite; for though he seemed\\nrather surprised at the consideration that Alfred the Great was a\\nCatholic, or that apart from the Ten Commandments any conception of\\nmoral conduct had occurred to mankind, he was not stimulated to further\\ninquiries on these remote matters. Yet he aspired to what he regarded as\\nintellectual society, willingly entertained beneficed clergymen, and\\nbought the books he heard spoken of, arranging them carefully on the\\nshelves of what he called his library, and occasionally sitting alone in\\nthe same room with them. But some minds seem well glazed by nature\\nagainst the admission of knowledge, and Spike\\'s was one of them. It was\\nnot, however, entirely so with regard to politics. He had had a strong\\nopinion about the Reform Bill, and saw clearly that the large trading\\ntowns ought to send members. Portraits of the Reform heroes hung framed\\nand glazed in his library: he prided himself on being a Liberal. In this\\nlast particular, as well as in not giving benefactions and not making\\nloans without interest, he showed unquestionable firmness. On the Repeal\\nof the Corn Laws, again, he was thoroughly convinced. His mind was\\nexpansive towards foreign markets, and his imagination could see that\\nthe people from whom we took corn might be able to take the cotton goods\\nwhich they had hitherto dispensed with. On his conduct in these\\npolitical concerns, his wife, otherwise influential as a woman who\\nbelonged to a family with a title in it, and who had condescended in\\nmarrying him, could gain no hold: she had to blush a little at what was\\ncalled her husband\\'s \"radicalism\"--an epithet which was a very unfair\\nimpeachment of Spike, who never went to the root of anything. But he\\nunderstood his own trading affairs, and in this way became a genuine,\\nconstant political element. If he had been born a little later he could\\nhave been accepted as an eligible member of Parliament, and if he had\\nbelonged to a high family he might have done for a member of the\\nGovernment. Perhaps his indifference to \"views\" would have passed for\\nadministrative judiciousness, and he would have been so generally silent\\nthat he must often have been silent in the right place. But this is\\nempty speculation: there is no warrant for saying what Spike would have\\nbeen and known so as to have made a calculable political element, if he\\nhad not been educated by having to manage his trade. A small mind\\ntrained to useful occupation for the satisfying of private need becomes\\na representative of genuine class-needs. Spike objected to certain items\\nof legislation because they hampered his own trade, but his neighbours\\'\\ntrade was hampered by the same causes; and though he would have been\\nsimply selfish in a question of light or water between himself and a\\nfellow-townsman, his need for a change in legislation, being shared by\\nall his neighbours in trade, ceased to be simply selfish, and raised him\\nto a sense of common injury and common benefit. True, if the law could\\nhave been changed for the benefit of his particular business, leaving\\nthe cotton trade in general in a sorry condition while he prospered,\\nSpike might not have thought that result intolerably unjust; but the\\nnature of things did not allow of such a result being contemplated as\\npossible; it allowed of an enlarged market for Spike only through the\\nenlargement of his neighbours\\' market, and the Possible is always the\\nultimate master of our efforts and desires. Spike was obliged to\\ncontemplate a general benefit, and thus became public-spirited in spite\\nof himself. Or rather, the nature of things transmuted his active egoism\\ninto a demand for a public benefit. Certainly if Spike had been born a\\nmarquis he could not have had the same chance of being useful as a\\npolitical element. But he might have had the same appearance, have been\\nequally null in conversation, sceptical as to the reality of pleasure,\\nand destitute of historical knowledge; perhaps even dimly disliking\\nJesuitism as a quality in Catholic minds, or regarding Bacon as the\\ninventor of physical science. The depths of middle-aged gentlemen\\'s\\nignorance will never be known, for want of public examinations in this\\nbranch. THE WATCH-DOG OF KNOWLEDGE\\n\\nMordax is an admirable man, ardent in intellectual work,\\npublic-spirited, affectionate, and able to find the right words in\\nconveying ingenious ideas or elevated feeling. Pity that to all these\\ngraces he cannot add what would give them the utmost finish--the\\noccasional admission that he has been in the wrong, the occasional frank\\nwelcome of a new idea as something not before present to his mind! But\\nno: Mordax\\'s self-respect seems to be of that fiery quality which\\ndemands that none but the monarchs of thought shall have an advantage\\nover him, and in the presence of contradiction or the threat of having\\nhis notions corrected, he becomes astonishingly unscrupulous and cruel\\nfor so kindly and conscientious a man. \"You are fond of attributing those fine qualities to Mordax,\" said\\nAcer, the other day, \"but I have not much belief in virtues that are\\nalways requiring to be asserted in spite of appearances against them. True fairness and goodwill show themselves precisely where his are\\nconspicuously absent. I mean, in recognising claims which the rest of\\nthe world are not likely to stand up for. It does not need much love of\\ntruth and justice in me to say that Aldebaran is a bright star, or Isaac\\nNewton the greatest of discoverers; nor much kindliness in me to want my\\nnotes to be heard above the rest in a chorus of hallelujahs to one\\nalready crowned. Does the man who has the\\near of the public use his advantage tenderly towards poor fellows who\\nmay be hindered of their due if he treats their pretensions with scorn? That is my test of his justice and benevolence.\" My answer was, that his system of moral tests might be as delusive as\\nwhat ignorant people take to be tests of intellect and learning. If the\\nscholar or _savant_ cannot answer their haphazard questions on the\\nshortest notice, their belief in his capacity is shaken. But the\\nbetter-informed have given up the Johnsonian theory of mind as a pair of\\nlegs able to walk east or west according to choice. Intellect is no\\nlonger taken to be a ready-made dose of ability to attain eminence (or\\nmediocrity) in all departments; it is even admitted that application in\\none line of study or practice has often a laming effect in other\\ndirections, and that an intellectual quality or special facility which\\nis a furtherance in one medium of effort is a drag in another. We have\\nconvinced ourselves by this time that a man may be a sage in celestial\\nphysics and a poor creature in the purchase of seed-corn, or even in\\ntheorising about the affections; that he may be a mere fumbler in\\nphysiology and yet show a keen insight into human motives; that he may\\nseem the \"poor Poll\" of the company in conversation and yet write with\\nsome humorous vigour. It is not true that a man\\'s intellectual power is\\nlike the strength of a timber beam, to be measured by its weakest point. Why should we any more apply that fallacious standard of what is called\\nconsistency to a man\\'s moral nature, and argue against the existence of\\nfine impulses or habits of feeling in relation to his actions\\ngenerally, because those better movements are absent in a class of cases\\nwhich act peculiarly on an irritable form of his egoism? The mistake\\nmight be corrected by our taking notice that the ungenerous words or\\nacts which seem to us the most utterly incompatible with good\\ndispositions in the offender, are those which offend ourselves. All\\nother persons are able to draw a milder conclusion. Laniger, who has a\\ntemper but no talent for repartee, having been run down in a fierce way\\nby Mordax, is inwardly persuaded that the highly-lauded man is a wolf at\\nheart: he is much tried by perceiving that his own friends seem to think\\nno worse of the reckless assailant than they did before; and Corvus, who\\nhas lately been flattered by some kindness from Mordax, is unmindful\\nenough of Laniger\\'s feeling to dwell on this instance of good-nature\\nwith admiring gratitude. There is a fable that when the badger had been\\nstung all over by bees, a bear consoled him by a rhapsodic account of\\nhow he himself had just breakfasted on their honey. The badger replied,\\npeevishly, \"The stings are in my flesh, and the sweetness is on your\\nmuzzle.\" The bear, it is said, was surprised at the badger\\'s want of\\naltruism. But this difference of sensibility between Laniger and his friends only\\nmirrors in a faint way the difference between his own point of view and\\nthat of the man who has injured him. If those neutral, perhaps even\\naffectionate persons, form no lively conception of what Laniger suffers,\\nhow should Mordax have any such sympathetic imagination to check him in\\nwhat he persuades himself is a scourging administered by the qualified\\nman to the unqualified? Depend upon it, his conscience, though active\\nenough in some relations, has never given him a twinge because of his\\npolemical rudeness and even brutality. He would go from the room where\\nhe has been tiring himself through the watches of the night in lifting\\nand turning a sick friend, and straightway write a reply or rejoinder in\\nwhich he mercilessly pilloried a Laniger who had supposed that he could\\ntell the world something else or more than had been sanctioned by the\\neminent Mordax--and what was worse, had sometimes really done so. Does\\nthis nullify the genuineness of motive which made him tender to his\\nsuffering friend? It only proves that his arrogant egoism,\\nset on fire, sends up smoke and flame where just before there had been\\nthe dews of fellowship and pity. He is angry and equips himself\\naccordingly--with a penknife to give the offender a _comprachico_\\ncountenance, a mirror to show him the effect, and a pair of nailed boots\\nto give him his dismissal. All this to teach him who the Romans really\\nwere, and to purge Inquiry of incompetent intrusion, so rendering an\\nimportant service to mankind. When a man is in a rage and wants to hurt another in consequence, he can\\nalways regard himself as the civil arm of a spiritual power, and all the\\nmore easily because there is real need to assert the righteous efficacy\\nof indignation. I for my part feel with the Lanigers, and should object\\nall the more to their or my being lacerated and dressed with salt, if\\nthe administrator of such torture alleged as a motive his care for Truth\\nand posterity, and got himself pictured with a halo in consequence. In\\ntransactions between fellow-men it is well to consider a little, in the\\nfirst place, what is fair and kind towards the person immediately\\nconcerned, before we spit and roast him on behalf of the next century\\nbut one. Wide-reaching motives, blessed and glorious as they are, and of\\nthe highest sacramental virtue, have their dangers, like all else that\\ntouches the mixed life of the earth. They are archangels with awful brow\\nand flaming sword, summoning and encouraging us to do the right and the\\ndivinely heroic, and we feel a beneficent tremor in their presence; but\\nto learn what it is they thus summon us to do, we have to consider the\\nmortals we are elbowing, who are of our own stature and our own\\nappetites. I cannot feel sure how my voting will affect the condition of\\nCentral Asia in the coming ages, but I have good reason to believe that\\nthe future populations there will be none the worse off because I\\nabstain from conjectural vilification of my opponents during the present\\nparliamentary session, and I am very sure that I shall be less injurious\\nto my contemporaries. On the whole, and in the vast majority of\\ninstances, the action by which we can do the best for future ages is of\\nthe sort which has a certain beneficence and grace for contemporaries. A\\nsour father may reform prisons, but considered in his sourness he does\\nharm. The deed of Judas has been attributed to far-reaching views, and\\nthe wish to hasten his Master\\'s declaration of himself as the Messiah. Perhaps--I will not maintain the contrary--Judas represented his motive\\nin this way, and felt justified in his traitorous kiss; but my belief\\nthat he deserved, metaphorically speaking, to be where Dante saw him, at\\nthe bottom of the Malebolge, would not be the less strong because he was\\nnot convinced that his action was detestable. I refuse to accept a man\\nwho has the stomach for such treachery, as a hero impatient for the\\nredemption of mankind and for the beginning of a reign when the kisses\\nshall be those of peace and righteousness. All this is by the way, to show that my apology for Mordax was not\\nfounded on his persuasion of superiority in his own motives, but on the\\ncompatibility of unfair, equivocal, and even cruel actions with a nature\\nwhich, apart from special temptations, is kindly and generous; and also\\nto enforce the need of checks from a fellow-feeling with those whom our\\nacts immediately (not distantly) concern. Will any one be so hardy as to\\nmaintain that an otherwise worthy man cannot be vain and arrogant? I\\nthink most of us have some interest in arguing the contrary. And it is\\nof the nature of vanity and arrogance, if unchecked, to become cruel and\\nself-justifying. There are fierce beasts within: chain them, chain them,\\nand let them learn to cower before the creature with wider reason. This\\nis what one wishes for Mordax--that his heart and brain should restrain\\nthe outleap of roar and talons. As to his unwillingness to admit that an idea which he has not\\ndiscovered is novel to him, one is surprised that quick intellect and\\nshrewd observation do not early gather reasons for being ashamed of a\\nmental trick which makes one among the comic parts of that various actor\\nConceited Ignorance. I have a sort of valet and factotum, an excellent, respectable servant,\\nwhose spelling is so unvitiated by non-phonetic superfluities that he\\nwrites _night_ as _nit_. One day, looking over his accounts, I said to\\nhim jocosely, \"You are in the latest fashion with your spelling, Pummel:\\nmost people spell \"night\" with a _gh_ between the _i_ and the _t_, but\\nthe greatest scholars now spell it as you do.\" \"So I suppose, sir,\"\\nsays Pummel; \"I\\'ve see it with a _gh_, but I\\'ve noways give into that\\nmyself.\" You would never catch Pummel in an interjection of surprise. I\\nhave sometimes laid traps for his astonishment, but he has escaped them\\nall, either by a respectful neutrality, as of one who would not appear\\nto notice that his master had been taking too much wine, or else by that\\nstrong persuasion of his all-knowingness which makes it simply\\nimpossible for him to feel himself newly informed. If I tell him that\\nthe world is spinning round and along like a top, and that he is\\nspinning with it, he says, \"Yes, I\\'ve heard a deal of that in my time,\\nsir,\" and lifts the horizontal lines of his brow a little higher,\\nbalancing his head from side to side as if it were too painfully full. Whether I tell him that they cook puppies in China, that there are ducks\\nwith fur coats in Australia, or that in some parts of the world it is\\nthe pink of politeness to put your tongue out on introduction to a\\nrespectable stranger, Pummel replies, \"So I suppose, sir,\" with an air\\nof resignation to hearing my poor version of well-known things, such as\\nelders use in listening to lively boys lately presented with an\\nanecdote book. His utmost concession is, that what you state is what he\\nwould have supplied if you had given him _carte blanche_ instead of your\\nneedless instruction, and in this sense his favourite answer is, \"I\\nshould say.\" \"Pummel,\" I observed, a little irritated at not getting my coffee, \"if\\nyou were to carry your kettle and spirits of wine up a mountain of a\\nmorning, your water would boil there sooner.\" \"Or,\\nthere are boiling springs in Iceland. \"That\\'s\\nwhat I\\'ve been thinking, sir.\" I have taken to asking him hard questions, and as I expected, he never\\nadmits his own inability to answer them without representing it as\\ncommon to the human race. \"What is the cause of the tides, Pummel?\" Many gives their opinion, but if I\\nwas to give mine, it \\'ud be different.\" But while he is never surprised himself, he is constantly imagining\\nsituations of surprise for others. His own consciousness is that of one\\nso thoroughly soaked in knowledge that further absorption is\\nimpossible, but his neighbours appear to him to be in the state of\\nthirsty sponges which it is a charity to besprinkle. His great\\ninterest in thinking of foreigners is that they must be surprised at\\nwhat they see in England, and especially at the beef. He is often\\noccupied with the surprise Adam must have felt at the sight of the\\nassembled animals--\"for he was not like us, sir, used from a b\\'y to\\nWombwell\\'s shows.\" He is fond of discoursing to the lad who acts as\\nshoe-black and general subaltern, and I have overheard him saying to\\nthat small upstart, with some severity, \"Now don\\'t you pretend to know,\\nbecause the more you pretend the more I see your ignirance\"--a lucidity\\non his part which has confirmed my impression that the thoroughly\\nself-satisfied person is the only one fully to appreciate the charm of\\nhumility in others. Your diffident self-suspecting mortal is not very angry that others\\nshould feel more comfortable about themselves, provided they are not\\notherwise offensive: he is rather like the chilly person, glad to sit\\nnext a warmer neighbour; or the timid, glad to have a courageous\\nfellow-traveller. It cheers him to observe the store of small comforts\\nthat his fellow-creatures may find in their self-complacency, just as\\none is pleased to see poor old souls soothed by the tobacco and snuff\\nfor which one has neither nose nor stomach oneself. But your arrogant man will not tolerate a presumption which he sees to\\nbe ill-founded. The service he regards society as most in need of is to\\nput down the conceit which is so particularly rife around him that he is\\ninclined to believe it the growing characteristic of the present age. In\\nthe schools of Magna Graecia, or in the sixth century of our era, or\\neven under Kublai Khan, he finds a comparative freedom from that\\npresumption by which his contemporaries are stirring his able gall. The\\nway people will now flaunt notions which are not his without appearing\\nto mind that they are not his, strikes him as especially disgusting. It\\nmight seem surprising to us that one strongly convinced of his own value\\nshould prefer to exalt an age in which _he_ did not flourish, if it were\\nnot for the reflection that the present age is the only one in which\\nanybody has appeared to undervalue him. A HALF-BREED\\n\\nAn early deep-seated love to which we become faithless has its unfailing\\nNemesis, if only in that division of soul which narrows all newer joys\\nby the intrusion of regret and the established presentiment of change. I\\nrefer not merely to the love of a person, but to the love of ideas,\\npractical beliefs, and social habits. And faithlessness here means not a\\ngradual conversion dependent on enlarged knowledge, but a yielding to\\nseductive circumstance; not a conviction that the original choice was a\\nmistake, but a subjection to incidents that flatter a growing desire. In\\nthis sort of love it is the forsaker who has the melancholy lot; for an\\nabandoned belief may be more effectively vengeful than Dido. The child\\nof a wandering tribe caught young and trained to polite life, if he\\nfeels an hereditary yearning can run away to the old wilds and get his\\nnature into tune. But there is no such recovery possible to the man who\\nremembers what he once believed without being convinced that he was in\\nerror, who feels within him unsatisfied stirrings towards old beloved\\nhabits and intimacies from which he has far receded without conscious\\njustification or unwavering sense of superior attractiveness in the new. This involuntary renegade has his character hopelessly jangled and out\\nof tune. He is like an organ with its stops in the lawless condition of\\nobtruding themselves without method, so that hearers are amazed by the\\nmost unexpected transitions--the trumpet breaking in on the flute, and\\nthe oboee confounding both. Hence the lot of Mixtus affects me pathetically, notwithstanding that he\\nspends his growing wealth with liberality and manifest enjoyment. To\\nmost observers he appears to be simply one of the fortunate and also\\nsharp commercial men who began with meaning to be rich and have become\\nwhat they meant to be: a man never taken to be well-born, but\\nsurprisingly better informed than the well-born usually are, and\\ndistinguished among ordinary commercial magnates by a personal kindness\\nwhich prompts him not only to help the suffering in a material way\\nthrough his wealth, but also by direct ministration of his own; yet with\\nall this, diffusing, as it were, the odour of a man delightedly\\nconscious of his wealth as an equivalent for the other social\\ndistinctions of rank and intellect which he can thus admire without\\nenvying. Hardly one among those superficial observers can suspect that\\nhe aims or has ever aimed at being a writer; still less can they imagine\\nthat his mind is often moved by strong currents of regret and of the\\nmost unworldly sympathies from the memories of a youthful time when his\\nchosen associates were men and women whose only distinction was a\\nreligious, a philanthropic, or an intellectual enthusiasm, when the lady\\non whose words his attention most hung was a writer of minor religious\\nliterature, when he was a visitor and exhorter of the poor in the alleys\\nof a great provincial town, and when he attended the lectures given\\nspecially to young men by Mr Apollos, the eloquent congregational\\npreacher, who had studied in Germany and had liberal advanced views then\\nfar beyond the ordinary teaching of his sect. At that time Mixtus\\nthought himself a young man of socially reforming ideas, of religious\\nprinciples and religious yearnings. It was within his prospects also to\\nbe rich, but he looked forward to a use of his riches chiefly for\\nreforming and religious purposes. His opinions were of a strongly\\ndemocratic stamp, except that even then, belonging to the class of\\nemployers, he was opposed to all demands in the employed that would\\nrestrict the expansiveness of trade. He was the most democratic in\\nrelation to the unreasonable privileges of the aristocracy and landed\\ninterest; and he had also a religious sense of brotherhood with the\\npoor. Altogether, he was a sincerely benevolent young man, interested in\\nideas, and renouncing personal ease for the sake of study, religious\\ncommunion, and good works. If you had known him then you would have\\nexpected him to marry a highly serious and perhaps literary woman,\\nsharing his benevolent and religious habits, and likely to encourage\\nhis studies--a woman who along with himself would play a distinguished\\npart in one of the most enlightened religious circles of a great\\nprovincial capital. How is it that Mixtus finds himself in a London mansion, and in society\\ntotally unlike that which made the ideal of his younger years? Why, he married Scintilla, who fascinated him as she had fascinated\\nothers, by her prettiness, her liveliness, and her music. It is a common\\nenough case, that of a man being suddenly captivated by a woman nearly\\nthe opposite of his ideal; or if not wholly captivated, at least\\neffectively captured by a combination of circumstances along with an\\nunwarily manifested inclination which might otherwise have been\\ntransient. Mixtus was captivated and then captured on the worldly side\\nof his disposition, which had been always growing and flourishing side\\nby side with his philanthropic and religious tastes. He had ability in\\nbusiness, and he had early meant to be rich; also, he was getting rich,\\nand the taste for such success was naturally growing with the pleasure\\nof rewarded exertion. It was during a business sojourn in London that he\\nmet Scintilla, who, though without fortune, associated with families of\\nGreek merchants living in a style of splendour, and with artists\\npatronised by such wealthy entertainers. Mixtus on this occasion became\\nfamiliar with a world in which wealth seemed the key to a more brilliant\\nsort of dominance than that of a religious patron in the provincial\\ncircles of X. Would it not be possible to unite the two kinds of sway? A\\nman bent on the most useful ends might, _with a fortune large enough_,\\nmake morality magnificent, and recommend religious principle by showing\\nit in combination with the best kind of house and the most liberal of\\ntables; also with a wife whose graces, wit, and accomplishments gave a\\nfinish sometimes lacking even to establishments got up with that\\nunhesitating worldliness to which high cost is a sufficient reason. Now this lively lady knew nothing of\\nNonconformists, except that they were unfashionable: she did not\\ndistinguish one conventicle from another, and Mr Apollos with his\\nenlightened interpretations seemed to her as heavy a bore, if not quite\\nso ridiculous, as Mr Johns could have been with his solemn twang at the\\nBaptist chapel in the lowest suburbs, or as a local preacher among the\\nMethodists. In general, people who appeared seriously to believe in any\\nsort of doctrine, whether religious, social, or philosophical, seemed\\nrather absurd to Scintilla. Ten to one these theoretic people pronounced\\noddly, had some reason or other for saying that the most agreeable\\nthings were wrong, wore objectionable clothes, and wanted you to\\nsubscribe to something. They were probably ignorant of art and music,\\ndid not understand _badinage_, and, in fact, could talk of nothing\\namusing. In Scintilla\\'s eyes the majority of persons were ridiculous and\\ndeplorably wanting in that keen perception of what was good taste, with\\nwhich she herself was blest by nature and education; but the people\\nunderstood to be religious or otherwise theoretic, were the most\\nridiculous of all, without being proportionately amusing and invitable. Did Mixtus not discover this view of Scintilla\\'s before their marriage? Or did he allow her to remain in ignorance of habits and opinions which\\nhad made half the occupation of his youth? When a man is inclined to marry a particular woman, and has made any\\ncommittal of himself, this woman\\'s opinions, however different from his\\nown, are readily regarded as part of her pretty ways, especially if they\\nare merely negative; as, for example, that she does not insist on the\\nTrinity or on the rightfulness or expediency of church rates, but simply\\nregards her lover\\'s troubling himself in disputation on these heads as\\nstuff and nonsense. The man feels his own superior strength, and is sure\\nthat marriage will make no difference to him on the subjects about which\\nhe is in earnest. And to laugh at men\\'s affairs is a woman\\'s privilege,\\ntending to enliven the domestic hearth. If Scintilla had no liking for\\nthe best sort of nonconformity, she was without any troublesome bias\\ntowards Episcopacy, Anglicanism, and early sacraments, and was quite\\ncontented not to go to church. As to Scintilla\\'s acquaintance with her lover\\'s tastes on these\\nsubjects, she was equally convinced on her side that a husband\\'s queer\\nways while he was a bachelor would be easily laughed out of him when he\\nhad married an adroit woman. Mixtus, she felt, was an excellent\\ncreature, quite likable, who was getting rich; and Scintilla meant to\\nhave all the advantages of a rich man\\'s wife. She was not in the least a\\nwicked woman; she was simply a pretty animal of the ape kind, with an\\naptitude for certain accomplishments which education had made the most\\nof. But we have seen what has been the result to poor Mixtus. He has become\\nricher even than he dreamed of being, has a little palace in London, and\\nentertains with splendour the half-aristocratic, professional, and\\nartistic society which he is proud to think select. This society regards\\nhim as a clever fellow in his particular branch, seeing that he has\\nbecome a considerable capitalist, and as a man desirable to have on the\\nlist of one\\'s acquaintance. But from every other point of view Mixtus\\nfinds himself personally submerged: what he happens to think is not felt\\nby his esteemed guests to be of any consequence, and what he used to\\nthink with the ardour of conviction he now hardly ever expresses. He is\\ntransplanted, and the sap within him has long been diverted into other\\nthan the old lines of vigorous growth. How could he speak to the artist\\nCrespi or to Sir Hong Kong Bantam about the enlarged doctrine of Mr\\nApollos? How could he mention to them his former efforts towards\\nevangelising the inhabitants of the X. alleys? And his references to his\\nhistorical and geographical studies towards a survey of possible markets\\nfor English products are received with an air of ironical suspicion by\\nmany of his political friends, who take his pretension to give advice\\nconcerning the Amazon, the Euphrates, and the Niger as equivalent to the\\ncurrier\\'s wide views on the applicability of leather. He can only make a\\nfigure through his genial hospitality. It is in vain that he buys the\\nbest pictures and statues of the best artists. Nobody will call him a\\njudge in art. If his pictures and statues are well chosen it is\\ngenerally thought that Scintilla told him what to buy; and yet Scintilla\\nin other connections is spoken of as having only a superficial and\\noften questionable taste. Mixtus, it is decided, is a good fellow, not\\nignorant--no, really having a good deal of knowledge as well as sense,\\nbut not easy to classify otherwise than as a rich man. He has\\nconsequently become a little uncertain as to his own point of view, and\\nin his most unreserved moments of friendly intercourse, even when\\nspeaking to listeners whom he thinks likely to sympathise with the\\nearlier part of his career, he presents himself in all his various\\naspects and feels himself in turn what he has been, what he is, and what\\nothers take him to be (for this last status is what we must all more or\\nless accept). He will recover with some glow of enthusiasm the vision of\\nhis old associates, the particular limit he was once accustomed to trace\\nof freedom in religious speculation, and his old ideal of a worthy life;\\nbut he will presently pass to the argument that money is the only means\\nby which you can get what is best worth having in the world, and will\\narrive at the exclamation \"Give me money!\" with the tone and gesture of\\na man who both feels and knows. Then if one of his audience, not having\\nmoney, remarks that a man may have made up his mind to do without money\\nbecause he prefers something else, Mixtus is with him immediately,\\ncordially concurring in the supreme value of mind and genius, which\\nindeed make his own chief delight, in that he is able to entertain the\\nadmirable possessors of these attributes at his own table, though not\\nhimself reckoned among them. Yet, he will proceed to observe, there was\\na time when he sacrificed his sleep to study, and even now amid the\\npress of business he from time to time thinks of taking up the\\nmanuscripts which he hopes some day to complete, and is always\\nincreasing his collection of valuable works bearing on his favourite\\ntopics. And it is true that he has read much in certain directions, and\\ncan remember what he has read; he knows the history and theories of\\ncolonisation and the social condition of countries that do not at\\npresent consume a sufficiently large share of our products and\\nmanufactures. He continues his early habit of regarding the spread of\\nChristianity as a great result of our commercial intercourse with black,\\nbrown, and yellow populations; but this is an idea not spoken of in the\\nsort of fashionable society that Scintilla collects round her husband\\'s\\ntable, and Mixtus now philosophically reflects that the cause must come\\nbefore the effect, and that the thing to be directly striven for is the\\ncommercial intercourse, not excluding a little war if that also should\\nprove needful as a pioneer of Christianity. He has long been wont to\\nfeel bashful about his former religion; as if it were an old attachment\\nhaving consequences which he did not abandon but kept in decent privacy,\\nhis avowed objects and actual position being incompatible with their\\npublic acknowledgment. There is the same kind of fluctuation in his aspect towards social\\nquestions and duties. He has not lost the kindness that used to make him\\na benefactor and succourer of the needy, and he is still liberal in\\nhelping forward the clever and industrious; but in his active\\nsuperintendence of commercial undertakings he has contracted more and\\nmore of the bitterness which capitalists and employers often feel to be\\na reasonable mood towards obstructive proletaries. Hence many who this\\nis an idea not spoken of in the sort of fashionable society that\\nScintilla collects round her husband\\'s table, and Mixtus now\\nphilosophically reflects that the cause must come before the effect, and\\nthat the thing to be directly striven for is the commercial intercourse,\\nnot excluding a little war if that also should prove needful as a\\npioneer of Christianity. He has long been wont to feel bashful about his\\nformer religion; as if it were an old attachment having consequences\\nwhich he did not abandon but kept in decent privacy, his avowed objects\\nand actual position being incompatible with their public acknowledgment. There is the same kind of fluctuation in his aspect towards social\\nquestions and duties. He has not lost the kindness that used to make him\\na benefactor and succourer of the needy, and he is still liberal in\\nhelping forward the clever and industrious; but in his active\\nsuperintendence of commercial undertakings he has contracted more and\\nmore of the bitterness which capitalists and employers often feel to be\\na reasonable mood towards obstructive proletaries. Hence many who have\\noccasionally met him when trade questions were being discussed, conclude\\nhim to be indistinguishable from the ordinary run of moneyed and\\nmoney-getting men. Indeed, hardly any of his acquaintances know what\\nMixtus really is, considered as a whole--nor does Mixtus himself know\\nit. X.\\n\\n\\nDEBASING THE MORAL CURRENCY. \"Il ne faut pas mettre un ridicule ou il n\\'y en a point: c\\'est se gater\\nle gout, c\\'est corrompre son jugement et celui des autres. Mais le\\nridicule qui est quelque part, il faut l\\'y voir, l\\'en tirer avec grace\\net d\\'une maniere qui plaise et qui instruise.\" I am fond of quoting this passage from La Bruyere, because the subject\\nis one where I like to show a Frenchman on my side, to save my\\nsentiments from being set down to my peculiar dulness and deficient\\nsense of the ludicrous, and also that they may profit by that\\nenhancement of ideas when presented in a foreign tongue, that glamour of\\nunfamiliarity conferring a dignity on the foreign names of very common\\nthings, of which even a philosopher like Dugald Stewart confesses the\\ninfluence. I remember hearing a fervid woman attempt to recite in\\nEnglish the narrative of a begging Frenchman who described the violent\\ndeath of his father in the July days. The narrative had impressed her,\\nthrough the mists of her flushed anxiety to understand it, as something\\nquite grandly pathetic; but finding the facts turn out meagre, and her\\naudience cold, she broke off, saying, \"It sounded so much finer in\\nFrench--_j\\'ai vu le sang de mon pere_, and so on--I wish I could repeat\\nit in French.\" This was a pardonable illusion in an old-fashioned lady\\nwho had not received the polyglot education of the present day; but I\\nobserve that even now much nonsense and bad taste win admiring\\nacceptance solely by virtue of the French language, and one may fairly\\ndesire that what seems a just discrimination should profit by the\\nfashionable prejudice in favour of La Bruyere\\'s idiom. But I wish he had\\nadded that the habit of dragging the ludicrous into topics where the\\nchief interest is of a different or even opposite kind is a sign not of\\nendowment, but of deficiency. The art of spoiling is within reach of the\\ndullest faculty: the coarsest clown with a hammer in his hand might\\nchip the nose off every statue and bust in the Vatican, and stand\\ngrinning at the effect of his work. Because wit is an exquisite product\\nof high powers, we are not therefore forced to admit the sadly confused\\ninference of the monotonous jester that he is establishing his\\nsuperiority over every less facetious person, and over every topic on\\nwhich he is ignorant or insensible, by being uneasy until he has\\ndistorted it in the small cracked mirror which he carries about with him\\nas a joking apparatus. Some high authority is needed to give many worthy\\nand timid persons the freedom of muscular repose under the growing\\ndemand on them to laugh when they have no other reason than the peril of\\nbeing taken for dullards; still more to inspire them with the courage to\\nsay that they object to the theatrical spoiling for themselves and their\\nchildren of all affecting themes, all the grander deeds and aims of men,\\nby burlesque associations adapted to the taste of rich fishmongers in\\nthe stalls and their assistants in the gallery. The English people in\\nthe present generation are falsely reputed to know Shakspere (as, by\\nsome innocent persons, the Florentine mule-drivers are believed to have\\nknown the _Divina Commedia_, not, perhaps, excluding all the subtle\\ndiscourses in the _Purgatorio_ and _Paradiso_); but there seems a clear\\nprospect that in the coming generation he will be known to them through\\nburlesques, and that his plays will find a new life as pantomimes. A\\nbottle-nosed Lear will come on with a monstrous corpulence from which he\\nwill frantically dance himself free during the midnight storm; Rosalind\\nand Celia will join in a grotesque ballet with shepherds and\\nshepherdesses; Ophelia in fleshings and a voluminous brevity of\\ngrenadine will dance through the mad scene, finishing with the famous\\n\"attitude of the scissors\" in the arms of Laertes; and all the speeches\\nin \"Hamlet\" will be so ingeniously parodied that the originals will be\\nreduced to a mere _memoria technica_ of the improver\\'s puns--premonitory\\nsigns of a hideous millennium, in which the lion will have to lie down\\nwith the lascivious monkeys whom (if we may trust Pliny) his soul\\nnaturally abhors. I have been amazed to find that some artists whose own works have the\\nideal stamp, are quite insensible to the damaging tendency of the\\nburlesquing spirit which ranges to and fro and up and down on the earth,\\nseeing no reason (except a precarious censorship) why it should not\\nappropriate every sacred, heroic, and pathetic theme which serves to\\nmake up the treasure of human admiration, hope, and love. One would have\\nthought that their own half-despairing efforts to invest in worthy\\noutward shape the vague inward impressions of sublimity, and the\\nconsciousness of an implicit ideal in the commonest scenes, might have\\nmade them susceptible of some disgust or alarm at a species of burlesque\\nwhich is likely to render their compositions no better than a dissolving\\nview, where every noble form is seen melting into its preposterous\\ncaricature. It used to be imagined of the unhappy medieval Jews that\\nthey parodied Calvary by crucifying dogs; if they had been guilty they\\nwould at least have had the excuse of the hatred and rage begotten by\\npersecution. Are we on the way to a parody which shall have no other\\nexcuse than the reckless search after fodder for degraded\\nappetites--after the pay to be earned by pasturing Circe\\'s herd where\\nthey may defile every monument of that growing life which should have\\nkept them human? The world seems to me well supplied with what is genuinely ridiculous:\\nwit and humour may play as harmlessly or beneficently round the changing\\nfacets of egoism, absurdity, and vice, as the sunshine over the rippling\\nsea or the dewy meadows. Why should we make our delicious sense of the\\nludicrous, with its invigorating shocks of laughter and its\\nirrepressible smiles which are the outglow of an inward radiation as\\ngentle and cheering as the warmth of morning, flourish like a brigand on\\nthe robbery of our mental wealth?--or let it take its exercise as a\\nmadman might, if allowed a free nightly promenade, by drawing the\\npopulace with bonfires which leave some venerable structure a blackened\\nruin or send a scorching smoke across the portraits of the past, at\\nwhich we once looked with a loving recognition of fellowship, and\\ndisfigure them into butts of mockery?--nay, worse--use it to degrade the\\nhealthy appetites and affections of our nature as they are seen to be\\ndegraded in insane patients whose system, all out of joint, finds\\nmatter for screaming laughter in mere topsy-turvy, makes every passion\\npreposterous or obscene, and turns the hard-won order of life into a\\nsecond chaos hideous enough to make one wail that the first was ever\\nthrilled with light? This is what I call debasing the moral currency: lowering the value of\\nevery inspiring fact and tradition so that it will command less and less\\nof the spiritual products, the generous motives which sustain the charm\\nand elevation of our social existence--the something besides bread by\\nwhich man saves his soul alive. The bread-winner of the family may\\ndemand more and more coppery shillings, or assignats, or greenbacks for\\nhis day\\'s work, and so get the needful quantum of food; but let that\\nmoral currency be emptied of its value--let a greedy buffoonery debase\\nall historic beauty, majesty, and pathos, and the more you heap up the\\ndesecrated symbols the greater will be the lack of the ennobling\\nemotions which subdue the tyranny of suffering, and make ambition one\\nwith social virtue. And yet, it seems, parents will put into the hands of their children\\nridiculous parodies (perhaps with more ridiculous \"illustrations\") of\\nthe poems which stirred their own tenderness or filial piety, and carry\\nthem to make their first acquaintance with great men, great works, or\\nsolemn crises through the medium of some miscellaneous burlesque which,\\nwith its idiotic puns and farcical attitudes, will remain among their\\nprimary associations, and reduce them throughout their time of studious\\npreparation for life to the moral imbecility of an inward giggle at what\\nmight have stimulated their high emulation or fed the fountains of\\ncompassion, trust, and constancy. One wonders where these parents have\\ndeposited that stock of morally educating stimuli which is to be\\nindependent of poetic tradition, and to subsist in spite of the finest\\nimages being degraded and the finest words of genius being poisoned as\\nwith some befooling drug. Will fine wit, will exquisite humour prosper the more through this\\nturning of all things indiscriminately into food for a gluttonous\\nlaughter, an idle craving without sense of flavours? That delightful power which La Bruyere points to--\"le ridicule qui est\\nquelque part, il faut l\\'y voir, l\\'en tirer avec grace et d\\'une maniere\\nqui plaise et qui instruise\"--depends on a discrimination only\\ncompatible with the varied sensibilities which give sympathetic insight,\\nand with the justice of perception which is another name for grave\\nknowledge. Such a result is no more to be expected from faculties on the\\nstrain to find some small hook by which they may attach the lowest\\nincongruity to the most momentous subject, than it is to be expected of\\na sharper, watching for gulls in a great political assemblage, that he\\nwill notice the blundering logic of partisan speakers, or season his\\nobservation with the salt of historical parallels. But after all our\\npsychological teaching, and in the midst of our zeal for education, we\\nare still, most of us, at the stage of believing that mental powers and\\nhabits have somehow, not perhaps in the general statement, but in any\\nparticular case, a kind of spiritual glaze against conditions which we\\nare continually applying to them. We soak our children in habits of\\ncontempt and exultant gibing, and yet are confident that--as Clarissa\\none day said to me--\"We can always teach them to be reverent in the\\nright place, you know.\" And doubtless if she were to take her boys to\\nsee a burlesque Socrates, with swollen legs, dying in the utterance of\\ncockney puns, and were to hang up a sketch of this comic scene among\\ntheir bedroom prints, she would think this preparation not at all to the\\nprejudice of their emotions on hearing their tutor read that narrative\\nof the _Apology_ which has been consecrated by the reverent gratitude of\\nages. This is the impoverishment that threatens our posterity:--a new\\nFamine, a meagre fiend with lewd grin and clumsy hoof, is breathing a\\nmoral mildew over the harvest of our human sentiments. These are the\\nmost delicate elements of our too easily perishable civilisation. And\\nhere again I like to quote a French testimony. Sainte Beuve, referring\\nto a time of insurrectionary disturbance, says: \"Rien de plus prompt a\\nbaisser que la civilisation dans des crises comme celle-ci; on perd en\\ntrois semaines le resultat de plusieurs siecles. La civilisation, la\\n_vie_ est une chose apprise et inventee, qu\\'on le sache bien: \\'_Inventas\\naut qui vitam excoluere per artes_.\\' Les hommes apres quelques annees de\\npaix oublient trop cette verite: ils arrivent a croire que la _culture_\\nest chose innee, qu\\'elle est la meme chose que la _nature_. La\\nsauvagerie est toujours la a deux pas, et, des qu\\'on lache pied, elle\\nrecommence.\" We have been severely enough taught (if we were willing to\\nlearn) that our civilisation, considered as a splendid material fabric,\\nis helplessly in peril without the spiritual police of sentiments or\\nideal feelings. And it is this invisible police which we had need, as a\\ncommunity, strive to maintain in efficient force. How if a dangerous\\n\"Swing\" were sometimes disguised in a versatile entertainer devoted to\\nthe amusement of mixed audiences? And I confess that sometimes when I\\nsee a certain style of young lady, who checks our tender admiration with\\nrouge and henna and all the blazonry of an extravagant expenditure, with\\nslang and bold _brusquerie_ intended to signify her emancipated view of\\nthings, and with cynical mockery which she mistakes for penetration, I\\nam sorely tempted to hiss out \"_Petroleuse!_\" It is a small matter to\\nhave our palaces set aflame compared with the misery of having our sense\\nof a noble womanhood, which is the inspiration of a purifying shame, the\\npromise of life--penetrating affection, stained and blotted out by\\nimages of repulsiveness. John travelled to the hallway. These things come--not of higher education,\\nbut--of dull ignorance fostered into pertness by the greedy vulgarity\\nwhich reverses Peter\\'s visionary lesson and learns to call all things\\ncommon and unclean. The Tirynthians, according to an ancient story reported by Athenaeus,\\nbecoming conscious that their trick of laughter at everything and\\nnothing was making them unfit for the conduct of serious affairs,\\nappealed to the Delphic oracle for some means of cure. The god\\nprescribed a peculiar form of sacrifice, which would be effective if\\nthey could carry it through without laughing. They did their best; but\\nthe flimsy joke of a boy upset their unaccustomed gravity, and in this\\nway the oracle taught them that even the gods could not prescribe a\\nquick cure for a long vitiation, or give power and dignity to a people\\nwho in a crisis of the public wellbeing were at the mercy of a poor\\njest. THE WASP CREDITED WITH THE HONEYCOMB\\n\\nNo man, I imagine, would object more strongly than Euphorion to\\ncommunistic principles in relation to material property, but with regard\\nto property in ideas he entertains such principles willingly, and is\\ndisposed to treat the distinction between Mine and Thine in original\\nauthorship as egoistic, narrowing, and low. I have known him, indeed,\\ninsist at some expense of erudition on the prior right of an ancient, a\\nmedieval, or an eighteenth century writer to be credited with a view or\\nstatement lately advanced with some show of originality; and this\\nchampionship seems to imply a nicety of conscience towards the dead. Mary journeyed to the bathroom. He\\nis evidently unwilling that his neighbours should get more credit than\\nis due to them, and in this way he appears to recognise a certain\\nproprietorship even in spiritual production. But perhaps it is no real\\ninconsistency that, with regard to many instances of modern origination,\\nit is his habit to talk with a Gallic largeness and refer to the\\nuniverse: he expatiates on the diffusive nature of intellectual\\nproducts, free and all-embracing as the liberal air; on the\\ninfinitesimal smallness of individual origination compared with the\\nmassive inheritance of thought on which every new generation enters; on\\nthat growing preparation for every epoch through which certain ideas or\\nmodes of view are said to be in the air, and, still more metaphorically\\nspeaking, to be inevitably absorbed, so that every one may be excused\\nfor not knowing how he got them. Above all, he insists on the proper\\nsubordination of the irritable self, the mere vehicle of an idea or\\ncombination which, being produced by the sum total of the human race,\\nmust belong to that multiple entity, from the accomplished lecturer or\\npopulariser who transmits it, to the remotest generation of Fuegians or\\nHottentots, however indifferent these may be to the superiority of their\\nright above that of the eminently perishable dyspeptic author. One may admit that such considerations carry a profound truth to be\\neven religiously contemplated, and yet object all the more to the mode\\nin which Euphorion seems to apply them. I protest against the use of\\nthese majestic conceptions to do the dirty work of unscrupulosity and\\njustify the non-payment of conscious debts which cannot be defined or\\nenforced by the law. Especially since it is observable that the large\\nviews as to intellectual property which can apparently reconcile an\\nable person to the use of lately borrowed ideas as if they were his\\nown, when this spoliation is favoured by the public darkness, never\\nhinder him from joining in the zealous tribute of recognition and\\napplause to those warriors of Truth whose triumphal arches are seen in\\nthe public ways, those conquerors whose battles and \"annexations\" even\\nthe carpenters and bricklayers know by name. Surely the acknowledgment\\nof a mental debt which will not be immediately detected, and may never\\nbe asserted, is a case to which the traditional susceptibility to\\n\"debts of honour\" would be suitably transferred. There is no massive\\npublic opinion that can be expected to tell on these relations of\\nthinkers and investigators&mdash;relations to be thoroughly understood\\nand felt only by those who are interested in the life of ideas and\\nacquainted with their history. To lay false claim to an invention or\\ndiscovery which has an immediate market value; to vamp up a\\nprofessedly new book of reference by stealing from the pages of one\\nalready produced at the cost of much labour and material; to copy\\nsomebody else\\'s poem and send the manuscript to a magazine, or hand it\\nabout among; friends as an original \"effusion;\" to deliver an elegant\\nextract from a known writer as a piece of improvised\\neloquence:&mdash;these are the limits within which the dishonest\\npretence of originality is likely to get hissed or hooted and bring\\nmore or less shame on the culprit. It is not necessary to understand\\nthe merit of a performance, or even to spell with any comfortable\\nconfidence, in order to perceive at once that such pretences are not\\nrespectable. But the difference between these vulgar frauds, these\\ndevices of ridiculous jays whose ill-secured plumes are seen falling\\noff them as they run, and the quiet appropriation of other people\\'s\\nphilosophic or scientific ideas, can hardly be held to lie in their\\nmoral quality unless we take impunity as our criterion. The pitiable\\njays had no presumption in their favour and foolishly fronted an alert\\nincredulity; but Euphorion, the accomplished theorist, has an audience\\nwho expect much of him, and take it as the most natural thing in the\\nworld that every unusual view which he presents anonymously should be\\ndue solely to his ingenuity. His borrowings are no incongruous\\nfeathers awkwardly stuck on; they have an appropriateness which makes\\nthem seem an answer to anticipation, like the return phrases of a\\nmelody. Certainly one cannot help the ignorant conclusions of polite\\nsociety, and there are perhaps fashionable persons who, if a speaker\\nhas occasion to explain what the occipat is, will consider that he has\\nlately discovered that curiously named portion of the animal frame:\\none cannot give a genealogical introduction to every long-stored item\\nof fact or conjecture that may happen to be a revelation for the large\\nclass of persons who are understood to judge soundly on a small basis\\nof knowledge. But Euphorion would be very sorry to have it supposed\\nthat he is unacquainted with the history of ideas, and sometimes\\ncarries even into minutiae the evidence of his exact registration of\\nnames in connection with quotable phrases or suggestions: I can\\ntherefore only explain the apparent infirmity of his memory in cases\\nof larger \"conveyance\" by supposing that he is accustomed by the very\\nassociation of largeness to range them at once under those grand laws\\nof the universe in the light of which Mine and Thine disappear and are\\nresolved into Everybody\\'s or Nobody\\'s, and one man\\'s particular\\nobligations to another melt untraceably into the obligations of the\\nearth to the solar system in general. Euphorion himself, if a particular omission of acknowledgment were\\nbrought home to him, would probably take a narrower ground of\\nexplanation. It was a lapse of memory; or it did not occur to him as\\nnecessary in this case to mention a name, the source being well\\nknown--or (since this seems usually to act as a strong reason for\\nmention) he rather abstained from adducing the name because it might\\ninjure the excellent matter advanced, just as an obscure trade-mark\\ncasts discredit on a good commodity, and even on the retailer who has\\nfurnished himself from a quarter not likely to be esteemed first-rate. No doubt this last is a genuine and frequent reason for the\\nnon-acknowledgment of indebtedness to what one may call impersonal as\\nwell as personal sources: even an American editor of school classics\\nwhose own English could not pass for more than a syntactical shoddy of\\nthe cheapest sort, felt it unfavourable to his reputation for sound\\nlearning that he should be obliged to the Penny Cyclopaedia, and\\ndisguised his references to it under contractions in which _Us. took the place of the low word _Penny_. Works of this convenient stamp,\\neasily obtained and well nourished with matter, are felt to be like rich\\nbut unfashionable relations who are visited and received in privacy, and\\nwhose capital is used or inherited without any ostentatious insistance\\non their names and places of abode. As to memory, it is known that this\\nfrail faculty naturally lets drop the facts which are less flattering to\\nour self-love--when it does not retain them carefully as subjects not to\\nbe approached, marshy spots with a warning flag over them. But it is\\nalways interesting to bring forward eminent names, such as Patricius or\\nScaliger, Euler or Lagrange, Bopp or Humboldt. To know exactly what has\\nbeen drawn from them is erudition and heightens our own influence, which\\nseems advantageous to mankind; whereas to cite an author whose ideas may\\npass as higher currency under our own signature can have no object\\nexcept the contradictory one of throwing the illumination over his\\nfigure when it is important to be seen oneself. All these reasons must\\nweigh considerably with those speculative persons who have to ask\\nthemselves whether or not Universal Utilitarianism requires that in the\\nparticular instance before them they should injure a man who has been of\\nservice to them, and rob a fellow-workman of the credit which is due to\\nhim. After all, however, it must be admitted that hardly any accusation is\\nmore difficult to prove, and more liable to be false, than that of a\\nplagiarism which is the conscious theft of ideas and deliberate\\nreproduction of them as original. The arguments on the side of acquittal\\nare obvious and strong:--the inevitable coincidences of contemporary\\nthinking; and our continual experience of finding notions turning up in\\nour minds without any label on them to tell us whence they came; so that\\nif we are in the habit of expecting much from our own capacity we accept\\nthem at once as a new inspiration. Then, in relation to the elder\\nauthors, there is the difficulty first of learning and then of\\nremembering exactly what has been wrought into the backward tapestry of\\nthe world\\'s history, together with the fact that ideas acquired long ago\\nreappear as the sequence of an awakened interest or a line of inquiry\\nwhich is really new in us, whence it is conceivable that if we were\\nancients some of us might be offering grateful hecatombs by mistake, and\\nproving our honesty in a ruinously expensive manner. On the other hand,\\nthe evidence on which plagiarism is concluded is often of a kind which,\\nthough much trusted in questions of erudition and historical criticism,\\nis apt to lead us injuriously astray in our daily judgments, especially\\nof the resentful, condemnatory sort. How Pythagoras came by his ideas,\\nwhether St Paul was acquainted with all the Greek poets, what Tacitus\\nmust have known by hearsay and systematically ignored, are points on\\nwhich a false persuasion of knowledge is less damaging to justice and\\ncharity than an erroneous confidence, supported by reasoning\\nfundamentally similar, of my neighbour\\'s blameworthy behaviour in a case\\nwhere I am personally concerned. No premisses require closer scrutiny\\nthan those which lead to the constantly echoed conclusion, \"He must have\\nknown,\" or \"He must have read.\" I marvel that this facility of belief on\\nthe side of knowledge can subsist under the daily demonstration that the\\neasiest of all things to the human mind is _not_ to know and _not_ to\\nread. To praise, to blame, to shout, grin, or hiss, where others shout,\\ngrin, or hiss--these are native tendencies; but to know and to read are\\nartificial, hard accomplishments, concerning which the only safe\\nsupposition is, that as little of them has been done as the case admits. An author, keenly conscious of having written, can hardly help imagining\\nhis condition of lively interest to be shared by others, just as we are\\nall apt to suppose that the chill or heat we are conscious of must be\\ngeneral, or even to think that our sons and daughters, our pet schemes,\\nand our quarrelling correspondence, are themes to which intelligent\\npersons will listen long without weariness. But if the ardent author\\nhappen to be alive to practical teaching he will soon learn to divide\\nthe larger part of the enlightened public into those who have not read\\nhim and think it necessary to tell him so when they meet him in polite\\nsociety, and those who have equally abstained from reading him, but wish\\nto conceal this negation and speak of his \"incomparable works\" with that\\ntrust in testimony which always has its cheering side. Hence it is worse than foolish to entertain silent suspicions of\\nplagiarism, still more to give them voice, when they are founded on a\\nconstruction of probabilities which a little more attention to everyday\\noccurrences as a guide in reasoning would show us to be really\\nworthless, considered as proof. The length to which one man\\'s memory can\\ngo in letting drop associations that are vital to another can hardly\\nfind a limit. It is not to be supposed that a person desirous to make an\\nagreeable impression on you would deliberately choose to insist to you,\\nwith some rhetorical sharpness, on an argument which you were the first\\nto elaborate in public; yet any one who listens may overhear such\\ninstances of obliviousness. You naturally remember your peculiar\\nconnection with your acquaintance\\'s judicious views; but why should\\n_he_? Your fatherhood, which is an intense feeling to you, is only an\\nadditional fact of meagre interest for him to remember; and a sense of\\nobligation to the particular living fellow-struggler who has helped us\\nin our thinking, is not yet a form of memory the want of which is felt\\nto be disgraceful or derogatory, unless it is taken to be a want of\\npolite instruction, or causes the missing of a cockade on a day of\\ncelebration. In our suspicions of plagiarism we must recognise as the\\nfirst weighty probability, that what we who feel injured remember best\\nis precisely what is least likely to enter lastingly into the memory of\\nour neighbours. But it is fair to maintain that the neighbour who\\nborrows your property, loses it for a while, and when it turns up again\\nforgets your connection with it and counts it his own, shows himself so\\nmuch the feebler in grasp and rectitude of mind. Some absent persons\\ncannot remember the state of wear in their own hats and umbrellas, and\\nhave no mental check to tell them that they have carried home a\\nfellow-visitor\\'s more recent purchase: they may be excellent\\nhouseholders, far removed from the suspicion of low devices, but one\\nwishes them a more correct perception, and a more wary sense that a\\nneighbours umbrella may be newer than their own. True, some persons are so constituted that the very excellence of an\\nidea seems to them a convincing reason that it must be, if not solely,\\nyet especially theirs. It fits in so beautifully with their general\\nwisdom, it lies implicitly in so many of their manifested opinions, that\\nif they have not yet expressed it (because of preoccupation) it is\\nclearly a part of their indigenous produce, and is proved by their\\nimmediate eloquent promulgation of it to belong more naturally and\\nappropriately to them than to the person who seemed first to have\\nalighted on it, and who sinks in their all-originating consciousness to\\nthat low kind of entity, a second cause. This is not lunacy, nor\\npretence, but a genuine state of mind very effective in practice, and\\noften carrying the public with it, so that the poor Columbus is found to\\nbe a very faulty adventurer, and the continent is named after Amerigo. Lighter examples of this instinctive appropriation are constantly met\\nwith among brilliant talkers. Aquila is too agreeable and amusing for\\nany one who is not himself bent on display to be angry at his\\nconversational rapine--his habit of darting down on every morsel of\\nbooty that other birds may hold in their beaks, with an innocent air, as\\nif it were all intended for his use, and honestly counted on by him as a\\ntribute in kind. Hardly any man, I imagine, can have had less trouble in\\ngathering a showy stock of information than Aquila. On close inquiry you\\nwould probably find that he had not read one epoch-making book of modern\\ntimes, for he has a career which obliges him to much correspondence and\\nother official work, and he is too fond of being in company to spend his\\nleisure moments in study; but to his quick eye, ear, and tongue, a few\\npredatory excursions in conversation where there are instructed persons,\\ngradually furnish surprisingly clever modes of statement and allusion on\\nthe dominant topic. When he first adopts a subject he necessarily falls\\ninto mistakes, and it is interesting to watch his gradual progress into\\nfuller information and better nourished irony, without his ever needing\\nto admit that he has made a blunder or to appear conscious of\\ncorrection. Suppose, for example, he had incautiously founded some\\ningenious remarks on a hasty reckoning that nine thirteens made a\\nhundred and two, and the insignificant Bantam, hitherto silent, seemed\\nto spoil the flow of ideas by stating that the product could not be\\ntaken as less than a hundred and seventeen, Aquila would glide on in the\\nmost graceful manner from a repetition of his previous remark to the\\ncontinuation--\"All this is on the supposition that a hundred and two\\nwere all that could be got out of nine thirteens; but as all the world\\nknows that nine thirteens will yield,\" &c.--proceeding straightway into\\na new train of ingenious consequences, and causing Bantam to be regarded\\nby all present as one of those slow persons who take irony for\\nignorance, and who would warn the weasel to keep awake. How should a\\nsmall-eyed, feebly crowing mortal like him be quicker in arithmetic than\\nthe keen-faced forcible Aquila, in whom universal knowledge is easily\\ncredible? Looked into closely, the conclusion from a man\\'s profile,\\nvoice, and fluency to his certainty in multiplication beyond the\\ntwelves, seems to show a confused notion of the way in which very common\\nthings are connected; but it is on such false correlations that men\\nfound half their inferences about each other, and high places of trust\\nmay sometimes be held on no better foundation. It is a commonplace that words, writings, measures, and performances in\\ngeneral, have qualities assigned them not by a direct judgment on the\\nperformances themselves, but by a presumption of what they are likely to\\nbe, considering who is the performer. We all notice in our neighbours\\nthis reference to names as guides in criticism, and all furnish\\nillustrations of it in our own practice; for, check ourselves as we\\nwill, the first impression from any sort of work must depend on a\\nprevious attitude of mind, and this will constantly be determined by the\\ninfluences of a name. But that our prior confidence or want of\\nconfidence in given names is made up of judgments just as hollow as the\\nconsequent praise or blame they are taken to warrant, is less commonly\\nperceived, though there is a conspicuous indication of it in the\\nsurprise or disappointment often manifested in the disclosure of an\\nauthorship about which everybody has been making wrong guesses. No doubt\\nif it had been discovered who wrote the \\'Vestiges,\\' many an ingenious\\nstructure of probabilities would have been spoiled, and some disgust\\nmight have been felt for a real author who made comparatively so shabby\\nan appearance of likelihood. It is this foolish trust in prepossessions,\\nfounded on spurious evidence, which makes a medium of encouragement for\\nthose who, happening to have the ear of the public, give other people\\'s\\nideas the advantage of appearing under their own well-received name,\\nwhile any remonstrance from the real producer becomes an each person who\\nhas paid complimentary tributes in the wrong place. Hardly any kind of false reasoning is more ludicrous than this on the\\nprobabilities of origination. It would be amusing to catechise the\\nguessers as to their exact reasons for thinking their guess \"likely:\"\\nwhy Hoopoe of John\\'s has fixed on Toucan of Magdalen; why Shrike\\nattributes its peculiar style to Buzzard, who has not hitherto been\\nknown as a writer; why the fair Columba thinks it must belong to the\\nreverend Merula; and why they are all alike disturbed in their previous\\njudgment of its value by finding that it really came from Skunk, whom\\nthey had either not thought of at all, or thought of as belonging to a\\nspecies excluded by the nature of the case. Clearly they were all wrong\\nin their notion of the specific conditions, which lay unexpectedly in\\nthe small Skunk, and in him alone--in spite of his education nobody\\nknows where, in spite of somebody\\'s knowing his uncles and cousins, and\\nin spite of nobody\\'s knowing that he was cleverer than they thought him. Such guesses remind one of a fabulist\\'s imaginary council of animals\\nassembled to consider what sort of creature had constructed a honeycomb\\nfound and much tasted by Bruin and other epicures. The speakers all\\nstarted from the probability that the maker was a bird, because this was\\nthe quarter from which a wondrous nest might be expected; for the\\nanimals at that time, knowing little of their own history, would have\\nrejected as inconceivable the notion that a nest could be made by a\\nfish; and as to the insects, they were not willingly received in society\\nand their ways were little known. Several complimentary presumptions\\nwere expressed that the honeycomb was due to one or the other admired\\nand popular bird, and there was much fluttering on the part of the\\nNightingale and Swallow, neither of whom gave a positive denial, their\\nconfusion perhaps extending to their sense of identity; but the Owl\\nhissed at this folly, arguing from his particular knowledge that the\\nanimal which produced honey must be the Musk-rat, the wondrous nature of\\nwhose secretions required no proof; and, in the powerful logical\\nprocedure of the Owl, from musk to honey was but a step. Some\\ndisturbance arose hereupon, for the Musk-rat began to make himself\\nobtrusive, believing in the Owl\\'s opinion of his powers, and feeling\\nthat he could have produced the honey if he had thought of it; until an\\nexperimental Butcher-bird proposed to anatomise him as a help to\\ndecision. The hubbub increased, the opponents of the Musk-rat inquiring\\nwho his ancestors were; until a diversion was created by an able\\ndiscourse of the Macaw on structures generally, which he classified so\\nas to include the honeycomb, entering into so much admirable exposition\\nthat there was a prevalent sense of the honeycomb having probably been\\nproduced by one who understood it so well. But Bruin, who had probably\\neaten too much to listen with edification, grumbled in his low kind of\\nlanguage, that \"Fine words butter no parsnips,\" by which he meant to say\\nthat there was no new honey forthcoming. Perhaps the audience generally was beginning to tire, when the Fox\\nentered with his snout dreadfully swollen, and reported that the\\nbeneficent originator in question was the Wasp, which he had found much\\nsmeared with undoubted honey, having applied his nose to it--whence\\nindeed the able insect, perhaps justifiably irritated at what might seem\\na sign of scepticism, had stung him with some severity, an infliction\\nReynard could hardly regret, since the swelling of a snout normally so\\ndelicate would corroborate his statement and satisfy the assembly that\\nhe had really found the honey-creating genius. The Fox\\'s admitted acuteness, combined with the visible swelling, were\\ntaken as undeniable evidence, and the revelation undoubtedly met a\\ngeneral desire for information on a point of interest. Nevertheless,\\nthere was a murmur the reverse of delighted, and the feelings of some\\neminent animals were too strong for them: the Orang-outang\\'s jaw dropped\\nso as seriously to impair the vigour of his expression, the edifying\\nPelican screamed and flapped her wings, the Owl hissed again, the Macaw\\nbecame loudly incoherent, and the Gibbon gave his hysterical laugh;\\nwhile the Hyaena, after indulging in a more splenetic guffaw, agitated\\nthe question whether it would not be better to hush up the whole affair,\\ninstead of giving public recognition to an insect whose produce, it was\\nnow plain, had been much overestimated. But this narrow-spirited motion\\nwas negatived by the sweet-toothed majority. A complimentary deputation\\nto the Wasp was resolved on, and there was a confident hope that this\\ndiplomatic measure would tell on the production of honey. Ganymede was once a girlishly handsome precocious youth. That one cannot\\nfor any considerable number of years go on being youthful, girlishly\\nhandsome, and precocious, seems on consideration to be a statement as\\nworthy of credit as the famous syllogistic conclusion, \"Socrates was\\nmortal.\" But many circumstances have conspired to keep up in Ganymede\\nthe illusion that he is surprisingly young. He was the last born of his\\nfamily, and from his earliest memory was accustomed to be commended as\\nsuch to the care of his elder brothers and sisters: he heard his mother\\nspeak of him as her youngest darling with a loving pathos in her tone,\\nwhich naturally suffused his own view of himself, and gave him the\\nhabitual consciousness of being at once very young and very interesting. Then, the disclosure of his tender years was a constant matter of\\nastonishment to strangers who had had proof of his precocious talents,\\nand the astonishment extended to what is called the world at large when\\nhe produced \\'A Comparative Estimate of European Nations\\' before he was\\nwell out of his teens. All comers, on a first interview, told him that\\nhe was marvellously young, and some repeated the statement each time\\nthey saw him; all critics who wrote about him called attention to the\\nsame ground for wonder: his deficiencies and excesses were alike to be\\naccounted for by the flattering fact of his youth, and his youth was the\\ngolden background which set off his many-hued endowments. Here was\\nalready enough to establish a strong association between his sense of\\nidentity and his sense of being unusually young. But after this he\\ndevised and founded an ingenious organisation for consolidating the\\nliterary interests of all the four continents (subsequently including\\nAustralasia and Polynesia), he himself presiding in the central office,\\nwhich thus became a new theatre for the constantly repeated situation of\\nan astonished stranger in the presence of a boldly scheming\\nadministrator found to be remarkably young. If we imagine with due\\ncharity the effect on Ganymede, we shall think it greatly to his credit\\nthat he continued to feel the necessity of being something more than\\nyoung, and did not sink by rapid degrees into a parallel of that\\nmelancholy object, a superannuated youthful phenomenon. Happily he had\\nenough of valid, active faculty to save him from that tragic fate. He\\nhad not exhausted his fountain of eloquent opinion in his \\'Comparative\\nEstimate,\\' so as to feel himself, like some other juvenile celebrities,\\nthe sad survivor of his own manifest destiny, or like one who has risen\\ntoo early in the morning, and finds all the solid day turned into a\\nfatigued afternoon. He has continued to be productive both of schemes\\nand writings, being perhaps helped by the fact that his \\'Comparative\\nEstimate\\' did not greatly affect the currents of European thought, and\\nleft him with the stimulating hope that he had not done his best, but\\nmight yet produce what would make his youth more surprising than ever. I saw something of him through his Antinoues period, the time of rich\\nchesnut locks, parted not by a visible white line, but by a shadowed\\nfurrow from which they fell in massive ripples to right and left. In\\nthese slim days he looked the younger for being rather below the middle\\nsize, and though at last one perceived him contracting an indefinable\\nair of self-consciousness, a slight exaggeration of the facial\\nmovements, the attitudes, the little tricks, and the romance in\\nshirt-collars, which must be expected from one who, in spite of his\\nknowledge, was so exceedingly young, it was impossible to say that he\\nwas making any great mistake about himself. He was only undergoing one\\nform of a common moral disease: being strongly mirrored for himself in\\nthe remark of others, he was getting to see his real characteristics as\\na dramatic part, a type to which his doings were always in\\ncorrespondence. Owing to my absence on travel and to other causes I had\\nlost sight of him for several years, but such a separation between two\\nwho have not missed each other seems in this busy century only a\\npleasant reason, when they happen to meet again in some old accustomed\\nhaunt, for the one who has stayed at home to be more communicative about\\nhimself than he can well be to those who have all along been in his\\nneighbourhood. He had married in the interval, and as if to keep up his\\nsurprising youthfulness in all relations, he had taken a wife\\nconsiderably older than himself. It would probably have seemed to him a\\ndisturbing inversion of the natural order that any one very near to him\\nshould have been younger than he, except his own children who, however\\nyoung, would not necessarily hinder the normal surprise at the\\nyouthfulness of their father. And if my glance had revealed my\\nimpression on first seeing him again, he might have received a rather\\ndisagreeable shock, which was far from my intention. My mind, having\\nretained a very exact image of his former appearance, took note of\\nunmistakeable changes such as a painter would certainly not have made by\\nway of flattering his subject. He had lost his slimness, and that curved\\nsolidity which might have adorned a taller man was a rather sarcastic\\nthreat to his short figure. The English branch of the Teutonic race does\\nnot produce many fat youths, and I have even heard an American lady say\\nthat she was much \"disappointed\" at the moderate number and size of our\\nfat men, considering their reputation in the United States; hence a\\nstranger would now have been apt to remark that Ganymede was unusually\\nplump for a distinguished writer, rather than unusually young. Many long-standing prepossessions are as hard to be\\ncorrected as a long-standing mispronunciation, against which the direct\\nexperience of eye and ear is often powerless. And I could perceive that\\nGanymede\\'s inwrought sense of his surprising youthfulness had been\\nstronger than the superficial reckoning of his years and the merely\\noptical phenomena of the looking-glass. He now held a post under\\nGovernment, and not only saw, like most subordinate functionaries, how\\nill everything was managed, but also what were the changes that a high\\nconstructive ability would dictate; and in mentioning to me his own\\nspeeches and other efforts towards propagating reformatory views in his\\ndepartment, he concluded by changing his tone to a sentimental head\\nvoice and saying--\\n\\n\"But I am so young; people object to any prominence on my part; I can\\nonly get myself heard anonymously, and when some attention has been\\ndrawn the name is sure to creep out. The writer is known to be young,\\nand things are none the forwarder.\" \"Well,\" said I, \"youth seems the only drawback that is sure to diminish. You and I have seven years less of it than when we last met.\" returned Ganymede, as lightly as possible, at the same time\\ncasting an observant glance over me, as if he were marking the effect of\\nseven years on a person who had probably begun life with an old look,\\nand even as an infant had given his countenance to that significant\\ndoctrine, the transmigration of ancient souls into modern bodies. I left him on that occasion without any melancholy forecast that his\\nillusion would be suddenly or painfully broken up. I saw that he was\\nwell victualled and defended against a ten years\\' siege from ruthless\\nfacts; and in the course of time observation convinced me that his\\nresistance received considerable aid from without. Each of his written\\nproductions, as it came out, was still commented on as the work of a\\nvery young man. One critic, finding that he wanted solidity, charitably\\nreferred to his youth as an excuse. Another, dazzled by his brilliancy,\\nseemed to regard his youth as so wondrous that all other authors\\nappeared decrepit by comparison, and their style such as might be looked\\nfor from gentlemen of the old school. Able pens (according to a familiar\\nmetaphor) appeared to shake their heads good-humouredly, implying that\\nGanymede\\'s crudities were pardonable in one so exceedingly young. Such\\nunanimity amid diversity, which a distant posterity might take for\\nevidence that on the point of age at least there could have been no\\nmistake, was not really more difficult to account for than the\\nprevalence of cotton in our fabrics. Ganymede had been first introduced\\ninto the writing world as remarkably young, and it was no exceptional\\nconsequence that the first deposit of information about him held its\\nground against facts which, however open to observation, were not\\nnecessarily thought of. It is not so easy, with our rates and taxes and\\nneed for economy in all directions, to cast away an epithet or remark\\nthat turns up cheaply, and to go in expensive search after more genuine\\nsubstitutes. There is high Homeric precedent for keeping fast hold of an\\nepithet under all changes of circumstance, and so the precocious author\\nof the \\'Comparative Estimate\\' heard the echoes repeating \"Young\\nGanymede\" when an illiterate beholder at a railway station would have\\ngiven him forty years at least. Besides, important elders, sachems of\\nthe clubs and public meetings, had a genuine opinion of him as young\\nenough to be checked for speech on subjects which they had spoken\\nmistakenly about when he was in his cradle; and then, the midway parting\\nof his crisp hair, not common among English committee-men, formed a\\npresumption against the ripeness of his judgment which nothing but a\\nspeedy baldness could have removed. It is but fair to mention all these outward confirmations of Ganymede\\'s\\nillusion, which shows no signs of leaving him. It is true that he no\\nlonger hears expressions of surprise at his youthfulness, on a first\\nintroduction to an admiring reader; but this sort of external evidence\\nhas become an unnecessary crutch to his habitual inward persuasion. His\\nmanners, his costume, his suppositions of the impression he makes on\\nothers, have all their former correspondence with the dramatic part of\\nthe young genius. As to the incongruity of his contour and other little\\naccidents of physique, he is probably no more aware that they will\\naffect others as incongruities than Armida is conscious how much her\\nrouge provokes our notice of her wrinkles, and causes us to mention\\nsarcastically that motherly age which we should otherwise regard with\\naffectionate reverence. But let us be just enough to admit that there may be old-young coxcombs\\nas well as old-young coquettes. HOW WE COME TO GIVE OURSELVES FALSE TESTIMONIALS, AND BELIEVE IN THEM. It is my way when I observe any instance of folly, any queer habit, any\\nabsurd illusion, straightway to look for something of the same type in\\nmyself, feeling sure that amid all differences there will be a certain\\ncorrespondence; just as there is more or less correspondence in the\\nnatural history even of continents widely apart, and of islands in\\nopposite zones. No doubt men\\'s minds differ in what we may call their\\nclimate or share of solar energy, and a feeling or tendency which is\\ncomparable to a panther in one may have no more imposing aspect than\\nthat of a weasel in another: some are like a tropical habitat in which\\nthe very ferns cast a mighty shadow, and the grasses are a dry ocean in\\nwhich a hunter may be submerged; others like the chilly latitudes in\\nwhich your forest-tree, fit elsewhere to prop a mine, is a pretty\\nminiature suitable for fancy potting. The eccentric man might be\\ntypified by the Australian fauna, refuting half our judicious\\nassumptions of what nature allows. Still, whether fate commanded us to\\nthatch our persons among the Eskimos or to choose the latest thing in\\ntattooing among the Polynesian isles, our precious guide Comparison\\nwould teach us in the first place by likeness, and our clue to further\\nknowledge would be resemblance to what we already know. Hence, having a\\nkeen interest in the natural history of my inward self, I pursue this\\nplan I have mentioned of using my observation as a clue or lantern by\\nwhich I detect small herbage or lurking life; or I take my neighbour in\\nhis least becoming tricks or efforts as an opportunity for luminous\\ndeduction concerning the figure the human genus makes in the specimen\\nwhich I myself furnish. Introspection which starts with the purpose of finding out one\\'s own\\nabsurdities is not likely to be very mischievous, yet of course it is\\nnot free from dangers any more than breathing is, or the other functions\\nthat keep us alive and active. To judge of others by oneself is in its\\nmost innocent meaning the briefest expression for our only method of\\nknowing mankind; yet, we perceive, it has come to mean in many cases\\neither the vulgar mistake which reduces every man\\'s value to the very\\nlow figure at which the valuer himself happens to stand; or else, the\\namiable illusion of the higher nature misled by a too generous\\nconstruction of the lower. One cannot give a recipe for wise judgment:\\nit resembles appropriate muscular action, which is attained by the\\nmyriad lessons in nicety of balance and of aim that only practice can\\ngive. The danger of the inverse procedure, judging of self by what one\\nobserves in others, if it is carried on with much impartiality and\\nkeenness of discernment, is that it has a laming effect, enfeebling the\\nenergies of indignation and scorn, which are the proper scourges of\\nwrong-doing and meanness, and which should continually feed the\\nwholesome restraining power of public opinion. I respect the horsewhip\\nwhen applied to the back of Cruelty, and think that he who applies it is\\na more perfect human being because his outleap of indignation is not\\nchecked by a too curious reflection on the nature of guilt--a more\\nperfect human being because he more completely incorporates the best\\nsocial life of the race, which can never be constituted by ideas that\\nnullify action. This is the essence of Dante\\'s sentiment (it is painful\\nto think that he applies it very cruelly)--\\n\\n  \"E cortesia fu, lui esser villano\"[1]--\\n\\nand it is undeniable that a too intense consciousness of one\\'s kinship\\nwith all frailties and vices undermines the active heroism which battles\\nagainst wrong. But certainly nature has taken care that this danger should not at\\npresent be very threatening. One could not fairly describe the\\ngenerality of one\\'s neighbours as too lucidly aware of manifesting in\\ntheir own persons the weaknesses which they observe in the rest of her\\nMajesty\\'s subjects; on the contrary, a hasty conclusion as to schemes of\\nProvidence might lead to the supposition that one man was intended to\\ncorrect another by being most intolerant of the ugly quality or trick\\nwhich he himself possesses. Doubtless philosophers will be able to\\nexplain how it must necessarily be so, but pending the full extension of\\nthe _a priori_ method, which will show that only blockheads could expect\\nanything to be otherwise, it does seem surprising that Heloisa should be\\ndisgusted at Laura\\'s attempts to disguise her age, attempts which she\\nrecognises so thoroughly because they enter into her own practice; that\\nSemper, who often responds at public dinners and proposes resolutions on\\nplatforms, though he has a trying gestation of every speech and a bad\\ntime for himself and others at every delivery, should yet remark\\npitilessly on the folly of precisely the same course of action in\\nUbique; that Aliquis, who lets no attack on himself pass unnoticed, and\\nfor every handful of gravel against his windows sends a stone in reply,\\nshould deplore the ill-advised retorts of Quispiam, who does not\\nperceive that to show oneself angry with an adversary is to gratify him. To be unaware of our own little tricks of manner or our own mental\\nblemishes and excesses is a comprehensible unconsciousness; the puzzling\\nfact is that people should apparently take no account of their\\ndeliberate actions, and should expect them to be equally ignored by\\nothers. It is an inversion of the accepted order: _there_ it is the\\nphrases that are official and the conduct or privately manifested\\nsentiment that is taken to be real; _here_ it seems that the practice is\\ntaken to be official and entirely nullified by the verbal representation\\nwhich contradicts it. The thief making a vow to heaven of full\\nrestitution and whispering some reservations, expecting to cheat\\nOmniscience by an \"aside,\" is hardly more ludicrous than the many ladies\\nand gentlemen who have more belief, and expect others to have it, in\\ntheir own statement about their habitual doings than in the\\ncontradictory fact which is patent in the daylight. One reason of the\\nabsurdity is that we are led by a tradition about ourselves, so that\\nlong after a man has practically departed from a rule or principle, he\\ncontinues innocently to state it as a true description of his\\npractice--just as he has a long tradition that he is not an old\\ngentleman, and is startled when he is seventy at overhearing himself\\ncalled by an epithet which he has only applied to others. [Footnote 1: Inferno, xxxii. \"A person with your tendency of constitution should take as little sugar\\nas possible,\" said Pilulus to Bovis somewhere in the darker decades of\\nthis century. \"It has made a great difference to Avis since he took my\\nadvice in that matter: he used to consume half a pound a-day.\" \"Twenty-six large lumps every day of your life, Mr Bovis,\" says his\\nwife. \"You drop them into your tea, coffee, and whisky yourself, my dear, and\\nI count them.\" laughs Bovis, turning to Pilulus, that they may exchange a\\nglance of mutual amusement at a woman\\'s inaccuracy. Bovis had never said inwardly that he\\nwould take a large allowance of sugar, and he had the tradition about\\nhimself that he was a man of the most moderate habits; hence, with this\\nconviction, he was naturally disgusted at the saccharine excesses of\\nAvis. I have sometimes thought that this facility of men in believing that\\nthey are still what they once meant to be--this undisturbed\\nappropriation of a traditional character which is often but a melancholy\\nrelic of early resolutions, like the worn and soiled testimonial to\\nsoberness and honesty carried in the pocket of a tippler whom the need\\nof a dram has driven into peculation--may sometimes diminish the\\nturpitude of what seems a flat, barefaced falsehood. It is notorious\\nthat a man may go on uttering false assertions about his own acts till\\nhe at last believes in them: is it not possible that sometimes in the\\nvery first utterance there may be a shade of creed-reciting belief, a\\nreproduction of a traditional self which is clung to against all\\nevidence? There is no knowing all the disguises of the lying serpent. When we come to examine in detail what is the sane mind in the sane\\nbody, the final test of completeness seems to be a security of\\ndistinction between what we have professed and what we have done; what\\nwe have aimed at and what we have achieved; what we have invented and\\nwhat we have witnessed or had evidenced to us; what we think and feel in\\nthe present and what we thought and felt in the past. I know that there is a common prejudice which regards the habitual\\nconfusion of _now_ and _then_, of _it was_ and _it is_, of _it seemed\\nso_ and _I should like it to be so_, as a mark of high imaginative\\nendowment, while the power of precise statement and description is rated\\nlower, as the attitude of an everyday prosaic mind. High imagination is\\noften assigned or claimed as if it were a ready activity in fabricating\\nextravagances such as are presented by fevered dreams, or as if its\\npossessors were in that state of inability to give credible testimony\\nwhich would warrant their exclusion from the class of acceptable\\nwitnesses in a court of justice; so that a creative genius might fairly\\nbe subjected to the disability which some laws have stamped on dicers,\\nslaves, and other classes whose position was held perverting to their\\nsense of social responsibility. This endowment of mental confusion is often boasted of by persons whose\\nimaginativeness would not otherwise be known, unless it were by the slow\\nprocess of detecting that their descriptions and narratives were not to\\nbe trusted. Callista is always ready to testify of herself that she is\\nan imaginative person, and sometimes adds in illustration, that if she\\nhad taken a walk and seen an old heap of stones on her way, the account\\nshe would give on returning would include many pleasing particulars of\\nher own invention, transforming the simple heap into an interesting\\ncastellated ruin. This creative freedom is all very well in the right\\nplace, but before I can grant it to be a sign of unusual mental power, I\\nmust inquire whether, on being requested to give a precise description\\nof what she saw, she would be able to cast aside her arbitrary\\ncombinations and recover the objects she really perceived so as to make\\nthem recognisable by another person who passed the same way. Otherwise\\nher glorifying imagination is not an addition to the fundamental power\\nof strong, discerning perception, but a cheaper substitute. And, in\\nfact, I find on listening to Callista\\'s conversation, that she has a\\nvery lax conception even of common objects, and an equally lax memory of\\nevents. It seems of no consequence to her whether she shall say that a\\nstone is overgrown with moss or with lichen, that a building is of\\nsandstone or of granite, that Meliboeus once forgot to put on his cravat\\nor that he always appears without it; that everybody says so, or that\\none stock-broker\\'s wife said so yesterday; that Philemon praised\\nEuphemia up to the skies, or that he denied knowing any particular evil\\nof her. She is one of those respectable witnesses who would testify to\\nthe exact moment of an apparition, because any desirable moment will be\\nas exact as another to her remembrance; or who would be the most worthy\\nto witness the action of spirits on slates and tables because the action\\nof limbs would not probably arrest her attention. She would describe the\\nsurprising phenomena exhibited by the powerful Medium with the same\\nfreedom that she vaunted in relation to the old heap of stones. Her\\nsupposed imaginativeness is simply a very usual lack of discriminating\\nperception, accompanied with a less usual activity of misrepresentation,\\nwhich, if it had been a little more intense, or had been stimulated by\\ncircumstance, might have made her a profuse writer unchecked by the\\ntroublesome need of veracity. These characteristics are the very opposite of such as yield a fine\\nimagination, which is always based on a keen vision, a keen\\nconsciousness of what _is_, and carries the store of definite knowledge\\nas material for the construction of its inward visions. Witness Dante,\\nwho is at once the most precise and homely in his reproduction of actual\\nobjects, and the most soaringly at large in his imaginative\\ncombinations. On a much lower level we distinguish the hyperbole and\\nrapid development in descriptions of persons and events which are lit up\\nby humorous intention in the speaker--we distinguish this charming play\\nof intelligence which resembles musical improvisation on a given motive,\\nwhere the farthest sweep of curve is looped into relevancy by an\\ninstinctive method, from the florid inaccuracy or helpless exaggeration\\nwhich is really something commoner than the correct simplicity often\\ndepreciated as prosaic. Even if high imagination were to be identified with illusion, there\\nwould be the same sort of difference between the imperial wealth of\\nillusion which is informed by industrious submissive observation and the\\ntrumpery stage-property illusion which depends on the ill-defined\\nimpressions gathered by capricious inclination, as there is between a\\ngood and a bad picture of the Last Judgment. In both these the subject\\nis a combination never actually witnessed, and in the good picture the\\ngeneral combination may be of surpassing boldness; but on examination it\\nis seen that the separate elements have been closely studied from real\\nobjects. And even where we find the charm of ideal elevation with wrong\\ndrawing and fantastic colour, the charm is dependent on the selective\\nsensibility of the painter to certain real delicacies of form which\\nconfer the expression he longed to render; for apart from this basis of\\nan effect perceived in common, there could be no conveyance of aesthetic\\nmeaning by the painter to the beholder. In this sense it is as true to\\nsay of Fra Angelico\\'s Coronation of the Virgin, that it has a strain of\\nreality, as to say so of a portrait by Rembrandt, which also has its\\nstrain of ideal elevation due to Rembrandt\\'s virile selective\\nsensibility. To correct such self-flatterers as Callista, it is worth\\nrepeating that powerful imagination is not false outward vision, but\\nintense inward representation, and a creative energy constantly fed by\\nsusceptibility to the veriest minutiae of experience, which it\\nreproduces and constructs in fresh and fresh wholes; not the habitual\\nconfusion of provable fact with the fictions of fancy and transient\\ninclination, but a breadth of ideal association which informs every\\nmaterial object, every incidental fact with far-reaching memories and\\nstored residues of passion, bringing into new light the less obvious\\nrelations of human existence. The illusion to which it is liable is not\\nthat of habitually taking duck-ponds for lilied pools, but of being more\\nor less transiently and in varying degrees so absorbed in ideal vision\\nas to lose the consciousness of surrounding objects or occurrences; and\\nwhen that rapt condition is past, the sane genius discriminates clearly\\nbetween what has been given in this parenthetic state of excitement, and\\nwhat he has known, and may count on, in the ordinary world of\\nexperience. Dante seems to have expressed these conditions perfectly in\\nthat passage of the _Purgatorio_ where, after a triple vision which has\\nmade him forget his surroundings, he says--\\n\\n  \"Quando l\\'anima mia torno di fuori\\n    Alle cose che son fuor di lei vere,\\n    Io riconobbi i miei non falsi errori.\" --(c xv)\\n\\nHe distinguishes the ideal truth of his entranced vision from the series\\nof external facts to which his consciousness had returned. Isaiah gives\\nus the date of his vision in the Temple--\"the year that King Uzziah\\ndied\"--and if afterwards the mighty-winged seraphim were present with\\nhim as he trod the street, he doubtless knew them for images of memory,\\nand did not cry \"Look!\" Certainly the seer, whether prophet, philosopher, scientific discoverer,\\nor poet, may happen to be rather mad: his powers may have been used up,\\nlike Don Quixote\\'s, in their visionary or theoretic constructions, so\\nthat the reports of common-sense fail to affect him, or the continuous\\nstrain of excitement may have robbed his mind of its elasticity. It is\\nhard for our frail mortality to carry the burthen of greatness with\\nsteady gait and full alacrity of perception. But he is the strongest\\nseer who can support the stress of creative energy and yet keep that\\nsanity of expectation which consists in distinguishing, as Dante does,\\nbetween the _cose che son vere_ outside the individual mind, and the\\n_non falsi errori_ which are the revelations of true imaginative power. THE TOO READY WRITER\\n\\nOne who talks too much, hindering the rest of the company from taking\\ntheir turn, and apparently seeing no reason why they should not rather\\ndesire to know his opinion or experience in relation to all subjects, or\\nat least to renounce the discussion of any topic where he can make no\\nfigure, has never been praised for this industrious monopoly of work\\nwhich others would willingly have shared in. However various and\\nbrilliant his talk may be, we suspect him of impoverishing us by\\nexcluding the contributions of other minds, which attract our curiosity\\nthe more because he has shut them up in silence. Besides, we get tired\\nof a \"manner\" in conversation as in painting, when one theme after\\nanother is treated with the same lines and touches. I begin with a\\nliking for an estimable master, but by the time he has stretched his\\ninterpretation of the world unbrokenly along a palatial gallery, I have\\nhad what the cautious Scotch mind would call \"enough\" of him. There is\\nmonotony and narrowness already to spare in my own identity; what comes\\nto me from without should be larger and more impartial than the judgment\\nof any single interpreter. On this ground even a modest person, without\\npower or will to shine in the conversation, may easily find the\\npredominating talker a nuisance, while those who are full of matter on\\nspecial topics are continually detecting miserably thin places in the\\nweb of that information which he will not desist from imparting. Nobody\\nthat I know of ever proposed a testimonial to a man for thus\\nvolunteering the whole expense of the conversation. Why is there a different standard of judgment with regard to a writer\\nwho plays much the same part in literature as the excessive talker plays\\nin what is traditionally called conversation? The busy Adrastus, whose\\nprofessional engagements might seem more than enough for the nervous\\nenergy of one man, and who yet finds time to print essays on the chief\\ncurrent subjects, from the tri-lingual inscriptions, or the Idea of the\\nInfinite among the prehistoric Lapps, to the Colorado beetle and the\\ngrape disease in the south of France, is generally praised if not\\nadmired for the breadth of his mental range and his gigantic powers of\\nwork. Poor Theron, who has some original ideas on a subject to which he\\nhas given years of research and meditation, has been waiting anxiously\\nfrom month to month to see whether his condensed exposition will find a\\nplace in the next advertised programme, but sees it, on the contrary,\\nregularly excluded, and twice the space he asked for filled with the\\ncopious brew of Adrastus, whose name carries custom like a celebrated\\ntrade-mark. Why should the eager haste to tell what he thinks on the\\nshortest notice, as if his opinion were a needed preliminary to\\ndiscussion, get a man the reputation of being a conceited bore in\\nconversation, when nobody blames the same tendency if it shows itself in\\nprint? The excessive talker can only be in one gathering at a time, and\\nthere is the comfort of thinking that everywhere else other\\nfellow-citizens who have something to say may get a chance of delivering\\nthemselves; but the exorbitant writer can occupy space and spread over\\nit the more or less agreeable flavour of his mind in four \"mediums\" at\\nonce, and on subjects taken from the four winds. Such restless and\\nversatile occupants of literary space and time should have lived earlier\\nwhen the world wanted summaries of all extant knowledge, and this\\nknowledge being small, there was the more room for commentary and\\nconjecture. They might have played the part of an Isidor of Seville or a\\nVincent of Beauvais brilliantly, and the willingness to write everything\\nthemselves would have been strictly in place. In the present day, the\\nbusy retailer of other people\\'s knowledge which he has spoiled in the\\nhandling, the restless guesser and commentator, the importunate hawker\\nof undesirable superfluities, the everlasting word-compeller who rises\\nearly in the morning to praise what the world has already glorified, or\\nmakes himself haggard at night in writing out his dissent from what\\nnobody ever believed, is not simply \"gratis anhelans, multa agendo nihil\\nagens\"--he is an obstruction. Like an incompetent architect with too\\nmuch interest at his back, he obtrudes his ill-considered work where\\nplace ought to have been left to better men. Is it out of the question that we should entertain some scruple about\\nmixing our own flavour, as of the too cheap and insistent nutmeg, with\\nthat of every great writer and every great subject?--especially when our\\nflavour is all we have to give, the matter or knowledge having been\\nalready given by somebody else. What if we were only like the Spanish\\nwine-skins which impress the innocent stranger with the notion that the\\nSpanish grape has naturally a taste of leather? One could wish that even\\nthe greatest minds should leave some themes unhandled, or at least leave\\nus no more than a paragraph or two on them to show how well they did in\\nnot being more lengthy. Such entertainment of scruple can hardly be expected from the young; but\\nhappily their readiness to mirror the universe anew for the rest of\\nmankind is not encouraged by easy publicity. In the vivacious Pepin I\\nhave often seen the image of my early youth, when it seemed to me\\nastonishing that the philosophers had left so many difficulties\\nunsolved, and that so many great themes had raised no great poet to\\ntreat them. I had an elated sense that I should find my brain full of\\ntheoretic clues when I looked for them, and that wherever a poet had not\\ndone what I expected, it was for want of my insight. Not knowing what\\nhad been said about the play of Romeo and Juliet, I felt myself capable\\nof writing something original on its blemishes and beauties. In relation\\nto all subjects I had a joyous consciousness of that ability which is\\nprior to knowledge, and of only needing to apply myself in order to\\nmaster any task--to conciliate philosophers whose systems were at\\npresent but dimly known to me, to estimate foreign poets whom I had not\\nyet read, to show up mistakes in an historical monograph that roused my\\ninterest in an epoch which I had been hitherto ignorant of, when I\\nshould once have had time to verify my views of probability by looking\\ninto an encyclopaedia. So Pepin; save only that he is industrious while\\nI was idle. Like the astronomer in Rasselas, I swayed the universe in my\\nconsciousness without making any difference outside me; whereas Pepin,\\nwhile feeling himself powerful with the stars in their courses, really\\nraises some dust here below. He is no longer in his spring-tide, but\\nhaving been always busy he has been obliged to use his first impressions\\nas if they were deliberate opinions, and to range himself on the\\ncorresponding side in ignorance of much that he commits himself to; so\\nthat he retains some characteristics of a comparatively tender age, and\\namong them a certain surprise that there have not been more persons\\nequal to himself. Perhaps it is unfortunate for him that he early gained\\na hearing, or at least a place in print, and was thus encouraged in\\nacquiring a fixed habit of writing, to the exclusion of any other\\nbread-winning pursuit. He is already to be classed as a \"general\\nwriter,\" corresponding to the comprehensive wants of the \"general\\nreader,\" and with this industry on his hands it is not enough for him to\\nkeep up the ingenuous self-reliance of youth: he finds himself under an\\nobligation to be skilled in various methods of seeming to know; and\\nhaving habitually expressed himself before he was convinced, his\\ninterest in all subjects is chiefly to ascertain that he has not made a\\nmistake, and to feel his infallibility confirmed. That impulse to\\ndecide, that vague sense of being able to achieve the unattempted, that\\ndream of aerial unlimited movement at will without feet or wings, which\\nwere once but the joyous mounting of young sap, are already taking shape\\nas unalterable woody fibre: the impulse has hardened into \"style,\" and\\ninto a pattern of peremptory sentences; the sense of ability in the\\npresence of other men\\'s failures is turning into the official arrogance\\nof one who habitually issues directions which he has never himself been\\ncalled on to execute; the dreamy buoyancy of the stripling has taken on\\na fatal sort of reality in written pretensions which carry consequences. He is on the way to become like the loud-buzzing, bouncing Bombus who\\ncombines conceited illusions enough to supply several patients in a\\nlunatic asylum with the freedom to show himself at large in various\\nforms of print. If one who takes himself for the telegraphic centre of\\nall American wires is to be confined as unfit to transact affairs, what\\nshall we say to the man who believes himself in possession of the\\nunexpressed motives and designs dwelling in the breasts of all\\nsovereigns and all politicians? And I grieve to think that poor Pepin,\\nthough less political, may by-and-by manifest a persuasion hardly more\\nsane, for he is beginning to explain people\\'s writing by what he does\\nnot know about them. Yet he was once at the comparatively innocent stage\\nwhich I have confessed to be that of my own early astonishment at my\\npowerful originality; and copying the just humility of the old Puritan,\\nI may say, \"But for the grace of discouragement, this coxcombry might\\nhave been mine.\" Pepin made for himself a necessity of writing (and getting printed)\\nbefore he had considered whether he had the knowledge or belief that\\nwould furnish eligible matter. At first perhaps the necessity galled him\\na little, but it is now as easily borne, nay, is as irrepressible a\\nhabit as the outpouring of inconsiderate talk. He is gradually being\\ncondemned to have no genuine impressions, no direct consciousness of\\nenjoyment or the reverse from the quality of what is before him: his\\nperceptions are continually arranging themselves in forms suitable to a\\nprinted judgment, and hence they will often turn out to be as much to\\nthe purpose if they are written without any direct contemplation of the\\nobject, and are guided by a few external conditions which serve to\\nclassify it for him. In this way he is irrevocably losing the faculty of\\naccurate mental vision: having bound himself to express judgments which\\nwill satisfy some other demands than that of veracity, he has blunted\\nhis perceptions by continual preoccupation. We cannot command veracity\\nat will: the power of seeing and reporting truly is a form of health\\nthat has to be delicately guarded, and as an ancient Rabbi has solemnly\\nsaid, \"The penalty of untruth is untruth.\" But Pepin is only a mild\\nexample of the fact that incessant writing with a view to printing\\ncarries internal consequences which have often the nature of disease. And however unpractical it may be held to consider whether we have\\nanything to print which it is good for the world to read, or which has\\nnot been better said before, it will perhaps be allowed to be worth\\nconsidering what effect the printing may have on ourselves. Clearly\\nthere is a sort of writing which helps to keep the writer in a\\nridiculously contented ignorance; raising in him continually the sense\\nof having delivered himself effectively, so that the acquirement of more\\nthorough knowledge seems as superfluous as the purchase of costume for a\\npast occasion. He has invested his vanity (perhaps his hope of income)\\nin his own shallownesses and mistakes, and must desire their prosperity. Like the professional prophet, he learns to be glad of the harm that\\nkeeps up his credit, and to be sorry for the good that contradicts him. It is hard enough for any of us, amid the changing winds of fortune and\\nthe hurly-burly of events, to keep quite clear of a gladness which is\\nanother\\'s calamity; but one may choose not to enter on a course which\\nwill turn such gladness into a fixed habit of mind, committing ourselves\\nto be continually pleased that others should appear to be wrong in order\\nthat we may have the air of being right. In some cases, perhaps, it might be urged that Pepin has remained the\\nmore self-contented because he has _not_ written everything he believed\\nhimself capable of. He once asked me to read a sort of programme of the\\nspecies of romance which he should think it worth while to write--a\\nspecies which he contrasted in strong terms with the productions of\\nillustrious but overrated authors in this branch. Pepin\\'s romance was to\\npresent the splendours of the Roman Empire at the culmination of its\\ngrandeur, when decadence was spiritually but not visibly imminent: it\\nwas to show the workings of human passion in the most pregnant and\\nexalted of human circumstances, the designs of statesmen, the\\ninterfusion of philosophies, the rural relaxation and converse of\\nimmortal poets, the majestic triumphs of warriors, the mingling of the\\nquaint and sublime in religious ceremony, the gorgeous delirium of\\ngladiatorial shows, and under all the secretly working leaven of\\nChristianity. Such a romance would not call the attention of society to\\nthe dialect of stable-boys, the low habits of rustics, the vulgarity of\\nsmall schoolmasters, the manners of men in livery, or to any other form\\nof uneducated talk and sentiments: its characters would have virtues and\\nvices alike on the grand scale, and would express themselves in an\\nEnglish representing the discourse of the most powerful minds in the\\nbest Latin, or possibly Greek, when there occurred a scene with a Greek\\nphilosopher on a visit to Rome or resident there as a teacher. In this\\nway Pepin would do in fiction what had never been done before: something\\nnot at all like \\'Rienzi\\' or \\'Notre Dame de Paris,\\' or any other attempt\\nof that kind; but something at once more penetrating and more\\nmagnificent, more passionate and more philosophical, more panoramic yet\\nmore select: something that would present a conception of a gigantic\\nperiod; in short something truly Roman and world-historical. When Pepin gave me this programme to read he was much younger than at\\npresent. Some slight success in another vein diverted him from the\\nproduction of panoramic and select romance, and the experience of not\\nhaving tried to carry out his programme has naturally made him more\\nbiting and sarcastic on the failures of those who have actually written\\nromances without apparently having had a glimpse of a conception equal\\nto his. Indeed, I am often comparing his rather touchingly inflated\\n_naivete_ as of a small young person walking on tiptoe while he is\\ntalking of elevated things, at the time when he felt himself the author\\nof that unwritten romance, with his present epigrammatic curtness and\\naffectation of power kept strictly in reserve. His paragraphs now seem\\nto have a bitter smile in them, from the consciousness of a mind too\\npenetrating to accept any other man\\'s ideas, and too equally competent\\nin all directions to seclude his power in any one form of creation, but\\nrather fitted to hang over them all as a lamp of guidance to the\\nstumblers below. You perceive how proud he is of not being indebted to\\nany writer: even with the dead he is on the creditor\\'s side, for he is\\ndoing them the service of letting the world know what they meant better\\nthan those poor pre-Pepinians themselves had any means of doing, and he\\ntreats the mighty shades very cavalierly. Is this fellow--citizen of ours, considered simply in the light of a\\nbaptised Christian and tax-paying Englishman, really as madly\\nconceited, as empty of reverential feeling, as unveracious and careless\\nof justice, as full of catch-penny devices and stagey attitudinising as\\non examination his writing shows itself to be? He has\\narrived at his present pass in \"the literary calling\" through the\\nself-imposed obligation to give himself a manner which would convey the\\nimpression of superior knowledge and ability. He is much worthier and\\nmore admirable than his written productions, because the moral aspects\\nexhibited in his writing are felt to be ridiculous or disgraceful in the\\npersonal relations of life. In blaming Pepin\\'s writing we are accusing\\nthe public conscience, which is so lax and ill informed on the momentous\\nbearings of authorship that it sanctions the total absence of scruple in\\nundertaking and prosecuting what should be the best warranted of\\nvocations. Hence I still accept friendly relations with Pepin, for he has much\\nprivate amiability, and though he probably thinks of me as a man of\\nslender talents, without rapidity of _coup d\\'oeil_ and with no\\ncompensatory penetration, he meets me very cordially, and would not, I\\nam sure, willingly pain me in conversation by crudely declaring his low\\nestimate of my capacity. Yet I have often known him to insult my betters\\nand contribute (perhaps unreflectingly) to encourage injurious\\nconceptions of them--but that was done in the course of his professional\\nwriting, and the public conscience still leaves such writing nearly on\\nthe level of the Merry-Andrew\\'s dress, which permits an impudent\\ndeportment and extraordinary gambols to one who in his ordinary clothing\\nshows himself the decent father of a family. DISEASES OF SMALL AUTHORSHIP\\n\\nParticular callings, it is known, encourage particular diseases. There\\nis a painter\\'s colic: the Sheffield grinder falls a victim to the\\ninhalation of steel dust: clergymen so often have a certain kind of sore\\nthroat that this otherwise secular ailment gets named after them. And\\nperhaps, if we were to inquire, we should find a similar relation\\nbetween certain moral ailments and these various occupations, though\\nhere in the case of clergymen there would be specific differences: the\\npoor curate, equally with the rector, is liable to clergyman\\'s sore\\nthroat, but he would probably be found free from the chronic moral\\nailments encouraged by the possession of glebe and those higher chances\\nof preferment which follow on having a good position already. On the\\nother hand, the poor curate might have severe attacks of calculating\\nexpectancy concerning parishioners\\' turkeys, cheeses, and fat geese, or\\nof uneasy rivalry for the donations of clerical charities. Authors are so miscellaneous a class that\\ntheir personified diseases, physical and moral,\\nmight include the whole procession of human\\ndisorders, led by dyspepsia and ending in\\nmadness--the awful Dumb Show of a world-historic\\ntragedy. Take a large enough area\\nof human life and all comedy melts into\\ntragedy, like the Fool\\'s part by the side of\\nLear. The chief scenes get filled with erring\\nheroes, guileful usurpers, persecuted discoverers,\\ndying deliverers: everywhere the\\nprotagonist has a part pregnant with doom. The comedy sinks to an accessory, and if there\\nare loud laughs they seem a convulsive transition\\nfrom sobs; or if the comedy is touched\\nwith a gentle lovingness, the panoramic scene\\nis one where\\n\\n        \"Sadness is a kind of mirth\\n  So mingled as if mirth did make us sad\\n  And sadness merry. \"[1]\\n\\n[Footnote 1: Two Noble Kinsmen.] Daniel went back to the bathroom. But I did not set out on the wide survey that would carry me into\\ntragedy, and in fact had nothing more serious in my mind than certain\\nsmall chronic ailments that come of small authorship. I was thinking\\nprincipally of Vorticella, who flourished in my youth not only as a\\nportly lady walking in silk attire, but also as the authoress of a book\\nentitled \\'The Channel Islands, with Notes and an Appendix.\\' I would by\\nno means make it a reproach to her that she wrote no more than one book;\\non the contrary, her stopping there seems to me a laudable example. What\\none would have wished, after experience, was that she had refrained from\\nproducing even that single volume, and thus from giving her\\nself-importance a troublesome kind of double incorporation which became\\noppressive to her acquaintances, and set up in herself one of those\\nslight chronic forms of disease to which I have just referred. She lived\\nin the considerable provincial town of Pumpiter, which had its own\\nnewspaper press, with the usual divisions of political partisanship and\\nthe usual varieties of literary criticism--the florid and allusive, the\\n_staccato_ and peremptory, the clairvoyant and prophetic, the safe and\\npattern-phrased, or what one might call \"the many-a-long-day style.\" Vorticella being the wife of an important townsman had naturally the\\nsatisfaction of seeing \\'The Channel Islands\\' reviewed by all the organs\\nof Pumpiter opinion, and their articles or paragraphs held as naturally\\nthe opening pages in the elegantly bound album prepared by her for the\\nreception of \"critical opinions.\" This ornamental volume lay on a\\nspecial table in her drawing-room close to the still more gorgeously\\nbound work of which it was the significant effect, and every guest was\\nallowed the privilege of reading what had been said of the authoress and\\nher work in the \\'Pumpiter Gazette and Literary Watchman,\\' the \\'Pumpshire\\nPost,\\' the \\'Church Clock,\\' the \\'Independent Monitor,\\' and the lively but\\njudicious publication known as the \\'Medley Pie;\\' to be followed up, if\\nhe chose, by the instructive perusal of the strikingly confirmatory\\njudgments, sometimes concurrent in the very phrases, of journals from\\nthe most distant counties; as the \\'Latchgate Argus,\\' the Penllwy\\nUniverse,\\' the \\'Cockaleekie Advertiser,\\' the \\'Goodwin Sands Opinion,\\'\\nand the \\'Land\\'s End Times.\\' I had friends in Pumpiter and occasionally paid a long visit there. When\\nI called on Vorticella, who had a cousinship with my hosts, she had to\\nexcuse herself because a message claimed her attention for eight or ten\\nminutes, and handing me the album of critical opinions said, with a\\ncertain emphasis which, considering my youth, was highly complimentary,\\nthat she would really like me to read what I should find there. This\\nseemed a permissive politeness which I could not feel to be an\\noppression, and I ran my eyes over the dozen pages, each with a strip or\\nislet of newspaper in the centre, with that freedom of mind (in my case\\nmeaning freedom to forget) which would be a perilous way of preparing\\nfor examination. This _ad libitum_ perusal had its interest for me. The\\nprivate truth being that I had not read \\'The Channel Islands,\\' I was\\namazed at the variety of matter which the volume must contain to have\\nimpressed these different judges with the writer\\'s surpassing capacity\\nto handle almost all branches of inquiry and all forms of presentation. In Jersey she had shown herself an historian, in Guernsey a poetess, in\\nAlderney a political economist, and in Sark a humorist: there were\\nsketches of character scattered through the pages which might put our\\n\"fictionists\" to the blush; the style was eloquent and racy, studded\\nwith gems of felicitous remark; and the moral spirit throughout was so\\nsuperior that, said one, \"the recording angel\" (who is not supposed to\\ntake account of literature as such) \"would assuredly set down the work\\nas a deed of religion.\" The force of this eulogy on the part of several\\nreviewers was much heightened by the incidental evidence of their\\nfastidious and severe taste, which seemed to suffer considerably from\\nthe imperfections of our chief writers, even the dead and canonised: one\\nafflicted them with the smell of oil, another lacked erudition and\\nattempted (though vainly) to dazzle them with trivial conceits, one\\nwanted to be more philosophical than nature had made him, another in\\nattempting to be comic produced the melancholy effect of a half-starved\\nMerry-Andrew; while one and all, from the author of the \\'Areopagitica\\'\\ndownwards, had faults of style which must have made an able hand in the\\n\\'Latchgate Argus\\' shake the many-glanced head belonging thereto with a\\nsmile of compassionate disapproval. Not so the authoress of \\'The Channel\\nIslands:\\' Vorticella and Shakspere were allowed to be faultless. I\\ngathered that no blemishes were observable in the work of this\\naccomplished writer, and the repeated information that she was \"second\\nto none\" seemed after this superfluous. Her thick octavo--notes,\\nappendix and all--was unflagging from beginning to end; and the \\'Land\\'s\\nEnd Times,\\' using a rather dangerous rhetorical figure, recommended you\\nnot to take up the volume unless you had leisure to finish it at a\\nsitting. It had given one writer more pleasure than he had had for many\\na long day--a sentence which had a melancholy resonance, suggesting a\\nlife of studious languor such as all previous achievements of the human\\nmind failed to stimulate into enjoyment. I think the collection of\\ncritical opinions wound up with this sentence, and I had turned back to\\nlook at the lithographed sketch of the authoress which fronted the first\\npage of the album, when the fair original re-entered and I laid down the\\nvolume on its appropriate table. \"Well, what do you think of them?\" said Vorticella, with an emphasis\\nwhich had some significance unperceived by me. \"I know you are a great\\nstudent. Give me _your_ opinion of these opinions.\" \"They must be very gratifying to you,\" I answered with a little\\nconfusion, for I perceived that I might easily mistake my footing, and I\\nbegan to have a presentiment of an examination for which I was by no\\nmeans crammed. \"On the whole--yes,\" said Vorticella, in a tone of concession. \"A few of\\nthe notices are written with some pains, but not one of them has really\\ngrappled with the chief idea in the appendix. I don\\'t know whether you\\nhave studied political economy, but you saw what I said on page 398\\nabout the Jersey fisheries?\" I bowed--I confess it--with the mean hope that this movement in the nape\\nof my neck would be taken as sufficient proof that I had read, marked,\\nand learned. I do not forgive myself for this pantomimic falsehood, but\\nI was young and morally timorous, and Vorticella\\'s personality had an\\neffect on me something like that of a powerful mesmeriser when he\\ndirects all his ten fingers towards your eyes, as unpleasantly visible\\nducts for the invisible stream. I felt a great power of contempt in her,\\nif I did not come up to her expectations. \"Well,\" she resumed, \"you observe that not one of them has taken up that\\nargument. But I hope I convinced you about the drag-nets?\" Orientally speaking, I had lifted up my foot\\non the steep descent of falsity and was compelled to set it down on a\\nlower level. \"I should think you must be right,\" said I, inwardly\\nresolving that on the next topic I would tell the truth. \"I _know_ that I am right,\" said Vorticella. \"The fact is that no critic\\nin this town is fit to meddle with such subjects, unless it be Volvox,\\nand he, with all his command of language, is very superficial. It is\\nVolvox who writes in the \\'Monitor,\\' I hope you noticed how he\\ncontradicts himself?\" My resolution, helped by the equivalence of dangers, stoutly prevailed,\\nand I said, \"No.\" He is the only one who finds fault with me. He is\\na Dissenter, you know. The \\'Monitor\\' is the Dissenters\\' organ, but my\\nhusband has been so useful to them in municipal affairs that they would\\nnot venture to run my book down; they feel obliged to tell the truth\\nabout me. After praising me for my\\npenetration and accuracy, he presently says I have allowed myself to be\\nimposed upon and have let my active imagination run away with me. That\\nis like his dissenting impertinence. Active my imagination may be, but I\\nhave it under control. Little Vibrio, who writes the playful notice in\\nthe \\'Medley Pie,\\' has a clever hit at Volvox in that passage about the\\nsteeplechase of imagination, where the loser wants to make it appear\\nthat the winner was only run away with. But if you did not notice\\nVolvox\\'s self-contradiction you would not see the point,\" added\\nVorticella, with rather a chilling intonation. \"Or perhaps you did not\\nread the \\'Medley Pie\\' notice? Vibrio is a poor little tippling creature, but, as Mr Carlyle would say,\\nhe has an eye, and he is always lively.\" I did take up the book again, and read as demanded. \"It is very ingenious,\" said I, really appreciating the difficulty of\\nbeing lively in this connection: it seemed even more wonderful than that\\na Vibrio should have an eye. \"You are probably surprised to see no notices from the London press,\"\\nsaid Vorticella. \"I have one--a very remarkable one. But I reserve it\\nuntil the others have spoken, and then I shall introduce it to wind up. I shall have them reprinted, of course, and inserted in future copies. This from the \\'Candelabrum\\' is only eight lines in length, but full of\\nvenom. I think that will tell its\\nown tale, placed after the other critiques.\" \"People\\'s impressions are so different,\" said I. \"Some persons find \\'Don\\nQuixote\\' dull.\" \"Yes,\" said Vorticella, in emphatic chest tones, \"dulness is a matter of\\nopinion; but pompous! Perhaps he\\nmeans that my matter is too important for his taste; and I have no\\nobjection to _that_. I should just like\\nto read you that passage about the drag-nets, because I could make it\\nclearer to you.\" A second (less ornamental) copy was at her elbow and was already opened,\\nwhen to my great relief another guest was announced, and I was able to\\ntake my leave without seeming to run away from \\'The Channel Islands,\\'\\nthough not without being compelled to carry with me the loan of \"the\\nmarked copy,\" which I was to find advantageous in a re-perusal of the\\nappendix, and was only requested to return before my departure from\\nPumpiter. Looking into the volume now with some curiosity, I found it a\\nvery ordinary combination of the commonplace and ambitious, one of those\\nbooks which one might imagine to have been written under the old Grub\\nStreet coercion of hunger and thirst, if they were not known beforehand\\nto be the gratuitous productions of ladies and gentlemen whose\\ncircumstances might be called altogether easy, but for an uneasy vanity\\nthat happened to have been directed towards authorship. Its importance\\nwas that of a polypus, tumour, fungus, or other erratic outgrowth,\\nnoxious and disfiguring in its effect on the individual organism which\\nnourishes it. Poor Vorticella might not have been more wearisome on a\\nvisit than the majority of her neighbours, but for this disease of\\nmagnified self-importance belonging to small authorship. I understand\\nthat the chronic complaint of \\'The Channel Islands\\' never left her. As\\nthe years went on and the publication tended to vanish in the distance\\nfor her neighbours\\' memory, she was still bent on dragging it to the\\nforeground, and her chief interest in new acquaintances was the\\npossibility of lending them her book, entering into all details\\nconcerning it, and requesting them to read her album of \"critical\\nopinions.\" This really made her more tiresome than Gregarina, whose\\ndistinction was that she had had cholera, and who did not feel herself\\nin her true position with strangers until they knew it. My experience with Vorticella led me for a time into the false\\nsupposition that this sort of fungous disfiguration, which makes Self\\ndisagreeably larger, was most common to the female sex; but I presently\\nfound that here too the male could assert his superiority and show a\\nmore vigorous boredom. I have known a man with a single pamphlet\\ncontaining an assurance that somebody else was wrong, together with a\\nfew approved quotations, produce a more powerful effect of shuddering at\\nhis approach than ever Vorticella did with her varied octavo volume,\\nincluding notes and appendix. Males of more than one nation recur to my\\nmemory who produced from their pocket on the slightest encouragement a\\nsmall pink or buff duodecimo pamphlet, wrapped in silver paper, as a\\npresent held ready for an intelligent reader. \"A mode of propagandism,\"\\nyou remark in excuse; \"they wished to spread some useful corrective\\ndoctrine.\" Not necessarily: the indoctrination aimed at was perhaps to\\nconvince you of their own talents by the sample of an \"Ode on\\nShakspere\\'s Birthday,\" or a translation from Horace. Vorticella may pair off with Monas, who had also written his one\\nbook--\\'Here and There; or, a Trip from Truro to Transylvania\\'--and not\\nonly carried it in his portmanteau when he went on visits, but took the\\nearliest opportunity of depositing it in the drawing-room, and\\nafterwards would enter to look for it, as if under pressure of a need\\nfor reference, begging the lady of the house to tell him whether she,\\nhad seen \"a small volume bound in red.\" One hostess at last ordered it\\nto be carried into his bedroom to save his time; but it presently\\nreappeared in his hands, and was again left with inserted slips of paper\\non the drawing-room table. Depend upon it, vanity is human, native alike to men and women; only in\\nthe male it is of denser texture, less volatile, so that it less\\nimmediately informs you of its presence, but is more massive and capable\\nof knocking you down if you come into collision with it; while in women\\nvanity lays by its small revenges as in a needle-case always at hand. The difference is in muscle and finger-tips, in traditional habits and\\nmental perspective, rather than in the original appetite of vanity. It\\nis an approved method now to explain ourselves by a reference to the\\nraces as little like us as possible, which leads me to observe that in\\nFiji the men use the most elaborate hair-dressing, and that wherever\\ntattooing is in vogue the male expects to carry off the prize of\\nadmiration for pattern and workmanship. Arguing analogically, and\\nlooking for this tendency of the Fijian or Hawaian male in the eminent\\nEuropean, we must suppose that it exhibits itself under the forms of\\ncivilised apparel; and it would be a great mistake to estimate\\npassionate effort by the effect it produces on our perception or\\nunderstanding. It is conceivable that a man may have concentrated no\\nless will and expectation on his wristbands, gaiters, and the shape of\\nhis hat-brim, or an appearance which impresses you as that of the modern\\n\"swell,\" than the Ojibbeway on an ornamentation which seems to us much\\nmore elaborate. In what concerns the search for admiration at least, it\\nis not true that the effect is equal to the cause and resembles it. The\\ncause of a flat curl on the masculine forehead, such as might be seen\\nwhen George the Fourth was king, must have been widely different in\\nquality and intensity from the impression made by that small scroll of\\nhair on the organ of the beholder. Merely to maintain an attitude and\\ngait which I notice in certain club men, and especially an inflation of\\nthe chest accompanying very small remarks, there goes, I am convinced,\\nan expenditure of psychical energy little appreciated by the\\nmultitude--a mental vision of Self and deeply impressed beholders which\\nis quite without antitype in what we call the effect produced by that\\nhidden process. there is no need to admit that women would carry away the prize of\\nvanity in a competition where differences of custom were fairly\\nconsidered. A man cannot show his vanity in a tight skirt which forces\\nhim to walk sideways down the staircase; but let the match be between\\nthe respective vanities of largest beard and tightest skirt, and here\\ntoo the battle would be to the strong. It is a familiar example of irony in the degradation of words that \"what\\na man is worth\" has come to mean how much money he possesses; but there\\nseems a deeper and more melancholy irony in the shrunken meaning that\\npopular or polite speech assigns to \"morality\" and \"morals.\" The poor\\npart these words are made to play recalls the fate of those pagan\\ndivinities who, after being understood to rule the powers of the air and\\nthe destinies of men, came down to the level of insignificant demons, or\\nwere even made a farcical show for the amusement of the multitude. Talking to Melissa in a time of commercial trouble, I found her disposed\\nto speak pathetically of the disgrace which had fallen on Sir Gavial\\nMantrap, because of his conduct in relation to the Eocene Mines, and to\\nother companies ingeniously devised by him for the punishment of\\nignorance in people of small means: a disgrace by which the poor titled\\ngentleman was actually reduced to live in comparative obscurity on his\\nwife\\'s settlement of one or two hundred thousand in the consols. \"Surely your pity is misapplied,\" said I, rather dubiously, for I like\\nthe comfort of trusting that a correct moral judgment is the strong\\npoint in woman (seeing that she has a majority of about a million in our\\nislands), and I imagined that Melissa might have some unexpressed\\ngrounds for her opinion. \"I should have thought you would rather be\\nsorry for Mantrap\\'s victims--the widows, spinsters, and hard-working\\nfathers whom his unscrupulous haste to make himself rich has cheated of\\nall their savings, while he is eating well, lying softly, and after\\nimpudently justifying himself before the public, is perhaps joining in\\nthe General Confession with a sense that he is an acceptable object in\\nthe sight of God, though decent men refuse to meet him.\" \"Oh, all that about the Companies, I know, was most unfortunate. In\\ncommerce people are led to do so many things, and he might not know\\nexactly how everything would turn out. But Sir Gavial made a good use of\\nhis money, and he is a thoroughly _moral_ man.\" \"What do you mean by a thoroughly moral man?\" \"Oh, I suppose every one means the same by that,\" said Melissa, with a\\nslight air of rebuke. \"Sir Gavial is an excellent family man--quite\\nblameless there; and so charitable round his place at Tiptop. Very\\ndifferent from Mr Barabbas, whose life, my husband tells me, is most\\nobjectionable, with actresses and that sort of thing. I think a man\\'s\\nmorals should make a difference to us. I\\'m not sorry for Mr Barabbas,\\nbut _I am_ sorry for Sir Gavial Mantrap.\" I will not repeat my answer to Melissa, for I fear it was offensively\\nbrusque, my opinion being that Sir Gavial was the more pernicious\\nscoundrel of the two, since his name for virtue served as an effective\\npart of a swindling apparatus; and perhaps I hinted that to call such a\\nman moral showed rather a silly notion of human affairs. In fact, I had\\nan angry wish to be instructive, and Melissa, as will sometimes happen,\\nnoticed my anger without appropriating my instruction, for I have since\\nheard that she speaks of me as rather violent-tempered, and not over\\nstrict in my views of morality. I wish that this narrow use of words which are wanted in their full\\nmeaning were confined to women like Melissa. Seeing that Morality and\\nMorals under their _alias_ of Ethics are the subject of voluminous\\ndiscussion, and their true basis a pressing matter of dispute--seeing\\nthat the most famous book ever written on Ethics, and forming a chief\\nstudy in our colleges, allies ethical with political science or that\\nwhich treats of the constitution and prosperity of States, one might\\nexpect that educated men would find reason to avoid a perversion of\\nlanguage which lends itself to no wider view of life than that of\\nvillage gossips. Yet I find even respectable historians of our own and\\nof foreign countries, after showing that a king was treacherous,\\nrapacious, and ready to sanction gross breaches in the administration of\\njustice, end by praising him for his pure moral character, by which one\\nmust suppose them to mean that he was not lewd nor debauched, not the\\nEuropean twin of the typical Indian potentate whom Macaulay describes as\\npassing his life in chewing bang and fondling dancing-girls. And since\\nwe are sometimes told of such maleficent kings that they were religious,\\nwe arrive at the curious result that the most serious wide-reaching\\nduties of man lie quite outside both Morality and Religion--the one of\\nthese consisting in not keeping mistresses (and perhaps not drinking too\\nmuch), and the other in certain ritual and spiritual transactions with\\nGod which can be carried on equally well side by side with the basest\\nconduct towards men. With such a classification as this it is no wonder,\\nconsidering the strong reaction of language on thought, that many minds,\\ndizzy with indigestion of recent science and philosophy, are far to seek\\nfor the grounds of social duty, and without entertaining any private\\nintention of committing a perjury which would ruin an innocent man, or\\nseeking gain by supplying bad preserved meats to our navy, feel\\nthemselves speculatively obliged to inquire why they should not do so,\\nand are inclined to measure their intellectual subtlety by their\\ndissatisfaction with all answers to this \"Why?\" It is of little use to\\ntheorise in ethics while our habitual phraseology stamps the larger part\\nof our social duties as something that lies aloof from the deepest needs\\nand affections of our nature. The informal definitions of popular\\nlanguage are the only medium through which theory really affects the\\nmass of minds even among the nominally educated; and when a man whose\\nbusiness hours, the solid part of every day, are spent in an\\nunscrupulous course of public or private action which has every\\ncalculable chance of causing widespread injury and misery, can be called\\nmoral because he comes home to dine with his wife and children and\\ncherishes the happiness of his own hearth, the augury is not good for\\nthe use of high ethical and theological disputation. Not for one moment would one willingly lose sight of the truth that the\\nrelation of the sexes and the primary ties of kinship are the deepest\\nroots of human wellbeing, but to make them by themselves the equivalent\\nof morality is verbally to cut off the channels of feeling through\\nwhich they are the feeders of that wellbeing. They are the original\\nfountains of a sensibility to the claims of others, which is the bond of\\nsocieties; but being necessarily in the first instance a private good,\\nthere is always the danger that individual selfishness will see in them\\nonly the best part of its own gain; just as knowledge, navigation,\\ncommerce, and all the conditions which are of a nature to awaken men\\'s\\nconsciousness of their mutual dependence and to make the world one great\\nsociety, are the occasions of selfish, unfair action, of war and\\noppression, so long as the public conscience or chief force of feeling\\nand opinion is not uniform and strong enough in its insistance on what\\nis demanded by the general welfare. And among the influences that must\\n<DW44> a right public judgment, the degradation of words which involve\\npraise and blame will be reckoned worth protesting against by every\\nmature observer. To rob words of half their meaning, while they retain\\ntheir dignity as qualifications, is like allowing to men who have lost\\nhalf their faculties the same high and perilous command which they won\\nin their time of vigour; or like selling food and seeds after\\nfraudulently abstracting their best virtues: in each case what ought to\\nbe beneficently strong is fatally enfeebled, if not empoisoned. Until we\\nhave altered our dictionaries and have found some other word than\\n_morality_ to stand in popular use for the duties of man to man, let us\\nrefuse to accept as moral the contractor who enriches himself by using\\nlarge machinery to make pasteboard soles pass as leather for the feet of\\nunhappy conscripts fighting at miserable odds against invaders: let us\\nrather call him a miscreant, though he were the tenderest, most faithful\\nof husbands, and contend that his own experience of home happiness makes\\nhis reckless infliction of suffering on others all the more atrocious. Let us refuse to accept as moral any political leader who should allow\\nhis conduct in relation to great issues to be determined by egoistic\\npassion, and boldly say that he would be less immoral even though he\\nwere as lax in his personal habits as Sir Robert Walpole, if at the same\\ntime his sense of the public welfare were supreme in his mind, quelling\\nall pettier impulses beneath a magnanimous impartiality. And though we\\nwere to find among that class of journalists who live by recklessly\\nreporting injurious rumours, insinuating the blackest motives in\\nopponents, descanting at large and with an air of infallibility on\\ndreams which they both find and interpret, and stimulating bad feeling\\nbetween nations by abusive writing which is as empty of real conviction\\nas the rage of a pantomime king, and would be ludicrous if its effects\\ndid not make it appear diabolical--though we were to find among these a\\nman who was benignancy itself in his own circle, a healer of private\\ndifferences, a soother in private calamities, let us pronounce him\\nnevertheless flagrantly immoral, a root of hideous cancer in the\\ncommonwealth, turning the channels of instruction into feeders of social\\nand political disease. In opposite ways one sees bad effects likely to be encouraged by this\\nnarrow use of the word _morals_, shutting out from its meaning half\\nthose actions of a man\\'s life which tell momentously on the wellbeing of\\nhis fellow-citizens, and on the preparation of a future for the children\\ngrowing up around him. Thoroughness of workmanship, care in the\\nexecution of every task undertaken, as if it were the acceptance of a\\ntrust which it would be a breach of faith not to discharge well, is a\\nform of duty so momentous that if it were to die out from the feeling\\nand practice of a people, all reforms of institutions would be helpless\\nto create national prosperity and national happiness. Do we desire to\\nsee public spirit penetrating all classes of the community and affecting\\nevery man\\'s conduct, so that he shall make neither the saving of his\\nsoul nor any other private saving an excuse for indifference to the\\ngeneral welfare? But the sort of public spirit that\\nscamps its bread-winning work, whether with the trowel, the pen, or the\\noverseeing brain, that it may hurry to scenes of political or social\\nagitation, would be as baleful a gift to our people as any malignant\\ndemon could devise. One best part of educational training is that which\\ncomes through special knowledge and manipulative or other skill, with\\nits usual accompaniment of delight, in relation to work which is the\\ndaily bread-winning occupation--which is a man\\'s contribution to the\\neffective wealth of society in return for what he takes as his own\\nshare. But this duty of doing one\\'s proper work well, and taking care\\nthat every product of one\\'s labour shall be genuinely what it pretends\\nto be, is not only left out of morals in popular speech, it is very\\nlittle insisted on by public teachers, at least in the only effective\\nway--by tracing the continuous effects of ill-done work. Some of them\\nseem to be still hopeful that it will follow as a necessary consequence\\nfrom week-day services, ecclesiastical decoration, and improved\\nhymn-books; others apparently trust to descanting on self-culture in\\ngeneral, or to raising a general sense of faulty circumstances; and\\nmeanwhile lax, make-shift work, from the high conspicuous kind to the\\naverage and obscure, is allowed to pass unstamped with the disgrace of\\nimmorality, though there is not a member of society who is not daily\\nsuffering from it materially and spiritually, and though it is the fatal\\ncause that must degrade our national rank and our commerce in spite of\\nall open markets and discovery of available coal-seams. I suppose one may take the popular misuse of the words Morality and\\nMorals as some excuse for certain absurdities which are occasional\\nfashions in speech and writing--certain old lay-figures, as ugly as the\\nqueerest Asiatic idol, which at different periods get propped into\\nloftiness, and attired in magnificent Venetian drapery, so that whether\\nthey have a human face or not is of little consequence. One is, the\\nnotion that there is a radical, irreconcilable opposition between\\nintellect and morality. I do not mean the simple statement of fact,\\nwhich everybody knows, that remarkably able men have had very faulty\\nmorals, and have outraged public feeling even at its ordinary standard;\\nbut the supposition that the ablest intellect, the highest genius, will\\nsee through morality as a sort of twaddle for bibs and tuckers, a\\ndoctrine of dulness, a mere incident in human stupidity. We begin to\\nunderstand the acceptance of this foolishness by considering that we\\nlive in a society where we may hear a treacherous monarch, or a\\nmalignant and lying politician, or a man who uses either official or\\nliterary power as an instrument of his private partiality or hatred, or\\na manufacturer who devises the falsification of wares, or a trader who\\ndeals in virtueless seed-grains, praised or compassionated because of\\nhis excellent morals. Clearly if morality meant no more than such decencies as are practised\\nby these poisonous members of society, it would be possible to say,\\nwithout suspicion of light-headedness, that morality lay aloof from the\\ngrand stream of human affairs, as a small channel fed by the stream and\\nnot missed from it. While this form of nonsense is conveyed in the\\npopular use of words, there must be plenty of well-dressed ignorance at\\nleisure to run through a box of books, which will feel itself initiated\\nin the freemasonry of intellect by a view of life which might take for a\\nShaksperian motto--\\n\\n  \"Fair is foul and foul is fair,\\n  Hover through the fog and filthy air\"--\\n\\nand will find itself easily provided with striking conversation by the\\nrule of reversing all the judgments on good and evil which have come to\\nbe the calendar and clock-work of society. But let our habitual talk\\ngive morals their full meaning as the conduct which, in every human\\nrelation, would follow from the fullest knowledge and the fullest\\nsympathy--a meaning perpetually corrected and enriched by a more\\nthorough appreciation of dependence in things, and a finer sensibility\\nto both physical and spiritual fact--and this ridiculous ascription of\\nsuperlative power to minds which have no effective awe-inspiring vision\\nof the human lot, no response of understanding to the connection between\\nduty and the material processes by which the world is kept habitable for\\ncultivated man, will be tacitly discredited without any need to cite the\\nimmortal names that all are obliged to take as the measure of\\nintellectual rank and highly-charged genius. Suppose a Frenchman--I mean no disrespect to the great French nation,\\nfor all nations are afflicted with their peculiar parasitic growths,\\nwhich are lazy, hungry forms, usually characterised by a\\ndisproportionate swallowing apparatus: suppose a Parisian who should\\nshuffle down the Boulevard with a soul ignorant of the gravest cares and\\nthe deepest tenderness of manhood, and a frame more or less fevered by\\ndebauchery, mentally polishing into utmost refinement of phrase and\\nrhythm verses which were an enlargement on that Shaksperian motto, and\\nworthy of the most expensive title to be furnished by the vendors of\\nsuch antithetic ware as _Les_ _marguerites de l\\'Enfer_, or _Les delices\\nde Beelzebuth_. This supposed personage might probably enough regard his\\nnegation of those moral sensibilities which make half the warp and woof\\nof human history, his indifference to the hard thinking and hard\\nhandiwork of life, to which he owed even his own gauzy mental garments\\nwith their spangles of poor paradox, as the royalty of genius, for we\\nare used to witness such self-crowning in many forms of mental\\nalienation; but he would not, I think, be taken, even by his own\\ngeneration, as a living proof that there can exist such a combination as\\nthat of moral stupidity and trivial emphasis of personal indulgence with\\nthe large yet finely discriminating vision which marks the intellectual\\nmasters of our kind. Doubtless there are many sorts of transfiguration,\\nand a man who has come to be worthy of all gratitude and reverence may\\nhave had his swinish period, wallowing in ugly places; but suppose it\\nhad been handed down to us that Sophocles or Virgil had at one time made\\nhimself scandalous in this way: the works which have consecrated their\\nmemory for our admiration and gratitude are not a glorifying of\\nswinishness, but an artistic incorporation of the highest sentiment\\nknown to their age. All these may seem to be wide reasons for objecting to Melissa\\'s pity\\nfor Sir Gavial Mantrap on the ground of his good morals; but their\\nconnection will not be obscure to any one who has taken pains to observe\\nthe links uniting the scattered signs of our social development. SHADOWS OF THE COMING RACE. My friend Trost, who is no optimist as to the state of the universe\\nhitherto, but is confident that at some future period within the\\nduration of the solar system, ours will be the best of all possible\\nworlds--a hope which I always honour as a sign of beneficent\\nqualities--my friend Trost always tries to keep up my spirits under the\\nsight of the extremely unpleasant and disfiguring work by which many of\\nour fellow-creatures have to get their bread, with the assurance that\\n\"all this will soon be done by machinery.\" But he sometimes neutralises\\nthe consolation by extending it over so large an area of human labour,\\nand insisting so impressively on the quantity of energy which will thus\\nbe set free for loftier purposes, that I am tempted to desire an\\noccasional famine of invention in the coming ages, lest the humbler\\nkinds of work should be entirely nullified while there are still left\\nsome men and women who are not fit for the highest. Especially, when one considers the perfunctory way in which some of the\\nmost exalted tasks are already executed by those who are understood to\\nbe educated for them, there rises a fearful vision of the human race\\nevolving machinery which will by-and-by throw itself fatally out of\\nwork. When, in the Bank of England, I see a wondrously delicate machine\\nfor testing sovereigns, a shrewd implacable little steel Rhadamanthus\\nthat, once the coins are delivered up to it, lifts and balances each in\\nturn for the fraction of an instant, finds it wanting or sufficient, and\\ndismisses it to right or left with rigorous justice; when I am told of\\nmicrometers and thermopiles and tasimeters which deal physically with\\nthe invisible, the impalpable, and the unimaginable; of cunning wires\\nand wheels and pointing needles which will register your and my\\nquickness so as to exclude flattering opinion; of a machine for drawing\\nthe right conclusion, which will doubtless by-and-by be improved into\\nan automaton for finding true premises; of a microphone which detects\\nthe cadence of the fly\\'s foot on the ceiling, and may be expected\\npresently to discriminate the noises of our various follies as they\\nsoliloquise or converse in our brains--my mind seeming too small for\\nthese things, I get a little out of it, like an unfortunate savage too\\nsuddenly brought face to face with civilisation, and I exclaim--\\n\\n\"Am I already in the shadow of the Coming Race? and will the creatures\\nwho are to transcend and finally supersede us be steely organisms,\\ngiving out the effluvia of the laboratory, and performing with\\ninfallible exactness more than everything that we have performed with a\\nslovenly approximativeness and self-defeating inaccuracy?\" \"But,\" says Trost, treating me with cautious mildness on hearing me vent\\nthis raving notion, \"you forget that these wonder-workers are the slaves\\nof our race, need our tendance and regulation, obey the mandates of our\\nconsciousness, and are only deaf and dumb bringers of reports which we\\ndecipher and make use of. They are simply extensions of the human\\norganism, so to speak, limbs immeasurably more powerful, ever more\\nsubtle finger-tips, ever more mastery over the invisibly great and the\\ninvisibly small. Each new machine needs a new appliance of human skill\\nto construct it, new devices to feed it with material, and often\\nkeener-edged faculties to note its registrations or performances. How\\nthen can machines supersede us?--they depend upon us. \"I am not so sure of that,\" said I, getting back into my mind, and\\nbecoming rather wilful in consequence. \"If, as I have heard you contend,\\nmachines as they are more and more perfected will require less and less\\nof tendance, how do I know that they may not be ultimately made to\\ncarry, or may not in themselves evolve, conditions of self-supply,\\nself-repair, and reproduction, and not only do all the mighty and subtle\\nwork possible on this planet better than we could do it, but with the\\nimmense advantage of banishing from the earth\\'s atmosphere screaming\\nconsciousnesses which, in our comparatively clumsy race, make an\\nintolerable noise and fuss to each other about every petty ant-like\\nperformance, looking on at all work only as it were to spring a rattle\\nhere or blow a trumpet there, with a ridiculous sense of being\\neffective? I for my part cannot see any reason why a sufficiently\\npenetrating thinker, who can see his way through a thousand years or so,\\nshould not conceive a parliament of machines, in which the manners were\\nexcellent and the motions infallible in logic: one honourable\\ninstrument, a remote descendant of the Voltaic family, might discharge a\\npowerful current (entirely without animosity) on an honourable\\ninstrument opposite, of more upstart origin, but belonging to the\\nancient edge-tool race which we already at Sheffield see paring thick\\niron as if it were mellow cheese--by this unerringly directed discharge\\noperating on movements corresponding to what we call Estimates, and by\\nnecessary mechanical consequence on movements corresponding to what we\\ncall the Funds, which with a vain analogy we sometimes speak of as\\n\"sensitive.\" For every machine would be perfectly educated, that is to\\nsay, would have the suitable molecular adjustments, which would act not\\nthe less infallibly for being free from the fussy accompaniment of that\\nconsciousness to which our prejudice gives a supreme governing rank,\\nwhen in truth it is an idle parasite on the grand sequence of things.\" returned Trost, getting angry, and judging it\\nkind to treat me with some severity; \"what you have heard me say is,\\nthat our race will and must act as a nervous centre to the utmost\\ndevelopment of mechanical processes: the subtly refined powers of\\nmachines will react in producing more subtly refined thinking processes\\nwhich will occupy the minds set free from grosser labour. Say, for\\nexample, that all the scavengers work of London were done, so far as\\nhuman attention is concerned, by the occasional pressure of a brass\\nbutton (as in the ringing of an electric bell), you will then have a\\nmultitude of brains set free for the exquisite enjoyment of dealing with\\nthe exact sequences and high speculations supplied and prompted by the\\ndelicate machines which yield a response to the fixed stars, and give\\nreadings of the spiral vortices fundamentally concerned in the\\nproduction of epic poems or great judicial harangues. So far from\\nmankind being thrown out of work according to your notion,\" concluded\\nTrost, with a peculiar nasal note of scorn, \"if it were not for your\\nincurable dilettanteism in science as in all other things--if you had\\nonce understood the action of any delicate machine--you would perceive\\nthat the sequences it carries throughout the realm of phenomena would\\nrequire many generations, perhaps aeons, of understandings considerably\\nstronger than yours, to exhaust the store of work it lays open.\" \"Precisely,\" said I, with a meekness which I felt was praiseworthy; \"it\\nis the feebleness of my capacity, bringing me nearer than you to the\\nhuman average, that perhaps enables me to imagine certain results better\\nthan you can. Doubtless the very fishes of our rivers, gullible as they\\nlook, and slow as they are to be rightly convinced in another order of\\nfacts, form fewer false expectations about each other than we should\\nform about them if we were in a position of somewhat fuller intercourse\\nwith their species; for even as it is we have continually to be\\nsurprised that they do not rise to our carefully selected bait. Take me\\nthen as a sort of reflective and experienced carp; but do not estimate\\nthe justice of my ideas by my facial expression.\" says Trost (We are on very intimate terms.) \"Naturally,\" I persisted, \"it is less easy to you than to me to imagine\\nour race transcended and superseded, since the more energy a being is\\npossessed of, the harder it must be for him to conceive his own death. But I, from the point of view of a reflective carp, can easily imagine\\nmyself and my congeners dispensed with in the frame of things and giving\\nway not only to a superior but a vastly different kind of Entity. What I\\nwould ask you is, to show me why, since each new invention casts a new\\nlight along the pathway of discovery, and each new combination or\\nstructure brings into play more conditions than its inventor foresaw,\\nthere should not at length be a machine of such high mechanical and\\nchemical powers that it would find and assimilate the material to supply\\nits own waste, and then by a further evolution of internal molecular\\nmovements reproduce itself by some process of fission or budding. This\\nlast stage having been reached, either by man\\'s contrivance or as an\\nunforeseen result, one sees that the process of natural selection must\\ndrive men altogether out of the field; for they will long before have\\nbegun to sink into the miserable condition of those unhappy characters\\nin fable who, having demons or djinns at their beck, and being obliged\\nto supply them with work, found too much of everything done in too short\\na time. What demons so potent as molecular movements, none the less\\ntremendously potent for not carrying the futile cargo of a consciousness\\nscreeching irrelevantly, like a fowl tied head downmost to the saddle of\\na swift horseman? Under such uncomfortable circumstances our race will\\nhave diminished with the diminishing call on their energies, and by the\\ntime that the self-repairing and reproducing machines arise, all but a\\nfew of the rare inventors, calculators, and speculators will have become\\npale, pulpy, and cretinous from fatty or other degeneration, and behold\\naround them a scanty hydrocephalous offspring. As to the breed of the\\ningenious and intellectual, their nervous systems will at last have been\\noverwrought in following the molecular revelations of the immensely\\nmore powerful unconscious race, and they will naturally, as the less\\nenergetic combinations of movement, subside like the flame of a candle\\nin the sunlight Thus the feebler race, whose corporeal adjustments\\nhappened to be accompanied with a maniacal consciousness which imagined\\nitself moving its mover, will have vanished, as all less adapted\\nexistences do before the fittest--i.e., the existence composed of the\\nmost persistent groups of movements and the most capable of\\nincorporating new groups in harmonious relation. Who--if our\\nconsciousness is, as I have been given to understand, a mere stumbling\\nof our organisms on their way to unconscious perfection--who shall say\\nthat those fittest existences will not be found along the track of what\\nwe call inorganic combinations, which will carry on the most elaborate\\nprocesses as mutely and painlessly as we are now told that the minerals\\nare metamorphosing themselves continually in the dark laboratory of the\\nearth\\'s crust? Thus this planet may be filled with beings who will be\\nblind and deaf as the inmost rock, yet will execute changes as delicate\\nand complicated as those of human language and all the intricate web of\\nwhat we call its effects, without sensitive impression, without\\nsensitive impulse: there may be, let us say, mute orations, mute\\nrhapsodies, mute discussions, and no consciousness there even to enjoy\\nthe silence.\" \"The supposition is logical,\" said I. \"It is well argued from the\\npremises.\" cried Trost, turning on me with some fierceness. \"You\\ndon\\'t mean to call them mine, I hope.\" They seem to be flying about in the air with other\\ngerms, and have found a sort of nidus among my melancholy fancies. They bear the same relation to real belief as\\nwalking on the head for a show does to running away from an explosion or\\nwalking fast to catch the train.\" To discern likeness amidst diversity, it is well known, does not require\\nso fine a mental edge as the discerning of diversity amidst general\\nsameness. The primary rough classification depends on the prominent\\nresemblances of things: the progress is towards finer and finer\\ndiscrimination according to minute differences. Yet even at this stage\\nof European culture one\\'s attention is continually drawn to the\\nprevalence of that grosser mental sloth which makes people dull to the\\nmost ordinary prompting of comparison--the bringing things together\\nbecause of their likeness. The same motives, the same ideas, the same\\npractices, are alternately admired and abhorred, lauded and denounced,\\naccording to their association with superficial differences, historical\\nor actually social: even learned writers treating of great subjects\\noften show an attitude of mind not greatly superior in its logic to that\\nof the frivolous fine lady who is indignant at the frivolity of her\\nmaid. To take only the subject of the Jews: it would be difficult to find a\\nform of bad reasoning about them which has not been heard in\\nconversation or been admitted to the dignity of print; but the neglect\\nof resemblances is a common property of dulness which unites all the\\nvarious points of view--the prejudiced, the puerile, the spiteful, and\\nthe abysmally ignorant. That the preservation of national memories is an element and a means of\\nnational greatness, that their revival is a sign of reviving\\nnationality, that every heroic defender, every patriotic restorer, has\\nbeen inspired by such memories and has made them his watchword, that\\neven such a corporate existence as that of a Roman legion or an English\\nregiment has been made valorous by memorial standards,--these are the\\nglorious commonplaces of historic teaching at our public schools and\\nuniversities, being happily ingrained in Greek and Latin classics. They\\nhave also been impressed on the world by conspicuous modern instances. That there is a free modern Greece is due--through all infiltration of\\nother than Greek blood--to the presence of ancient Greece in the\\nconsciousness of European men; and every speaker would feel his point\\nsafe if he were to praise Byron\\'s devotion to a cause made glorious by\\nideal identification with the past; hardly so, if he were to insist that\\nthe Greeks were not to be helped further because their history shows\\nthat they were anciently unsurpassed in treachery and lying, and that\\nmany modern Greeks are highly disreputable characters, while others are\\ndisposed to grasp too large a share of our commerce. The same with\\nItaly: the pathos of his country\\'s lot pierced the youthful soul of\\nMazzini, because, like Dante\\'s, his blood was fraught with the kinship\\nof Italian greatness, his imagination filled with a majestic past that\\nwrought itself into a majestic future. Half a century ago, what was\\nItaly? An idling-place of dilettanteism or of itinerant motiveless\\nwealth, a territory parcelled out for papal sustenance, dynastic\\nconvenience, and the profit of an alien Government. No people, no voice in European counsels, no massive power in\\nEuropean affairs: a race thought of in English and French society as\\nchiefly adapted to the operatic stage, or to serve as models for\\npainters; disposed to smile gratefully at the reception of halfpence;\\nand by the more historical remembered to be rather polite than truthful,\\nin all probability a combination of Machiavelli, Rubini, and Masaniello. Thanks chiefly to the divine gift of a memory which inspires the moments\\nwith a past, a present, and a future, and gives the sense of corporate\\nexistence that raises man above the otherwise more respectable and\\ninnocent brute, all that, or most of it, is changed. Again, one of our living historians finds just sympathy in his vigorous\\ninsistance on our true ancestry, on our being the strongly marked\\nheritors in language and genius of those old English seamen who,\\nbeholding a rich country with a most convenient seaboard, came,\\ndoubtless with a sense of divine warrant, and settled themselves on this\\nor the other side of fertilising streams, gradually conquering more and\\nmore of the pleasant land from the natives who knew nothing of Odin,\\nand finally making unusually clean work in ridding themselves of those\\nprior occupants. \"Let us,\" he virtually says, \"let us know who were our\\nforefathers, who it was that won the soil for us, and brought the good\\nseed of those institutions through which we should not arrogantly but\\ngratefully feel ourselves distinguished among the nations as possessors\\nof long-inherited freedom; let us not keep up an ignorant kind of naming\\nwhich disguises our true affinities of blood and language, but let us\\nsee thoroughly what sort of notions and traditions our forefathers had,\\nand what sort of song inspired them. Let the poetic fragments which\\nbreathe forth their fierce bravery in battle and their trust in fierce\\ngods who helped them, be treasured with affectionate reverence. These\\nseafaring, invading, self-asserting men were the English of old time,\\nand were our fathers who did rough work by which we are profiting. They\\nhad virtues which incorporated themselves in wholesome usages to which\\nwe trace our own political blessings. Let us know and acknowledge our\\ncommon relationship to them, and be thankful that over and above the\\naffections and duties which spring from our manhood, we have the closer\\nand more constantly guiding duties which belong to us as Englishmen.\" To this view of our nationality most persons who have feeling and\\nunderstanding enough to be conscious of the connection between the\\npatriotic affection and every other affection which lifts us above\\nemigrating rats and free-loving baboons, will be disposed to say Amen. True, we are not indebted to those ancestors for our religion: we are\\nrather proud of having got that illumination from elsewhere. The men who\\nplanted our nation were not Christians, though they began their work\\ncenturies after Christ; and they had a decided objection to Christianity\\nwhen it was first proposed to them: they were not monotheists, and their\\nreligion was the reverse of spiritual. But since we have been fortunate\\nenough to keep the island-home they won for us, and have been on the\\nwhole a prosperous people, rather continuing the plan of invading and\\nspoiling other lands than being forced to beg for shelter in them,\\nnobody has reproached us because our fathers thirteen hundred years ago\\nworshipped Odin, massacred Britons, and were with difficulty persuaded\\nto accept Christianity, knowing nothing of Hebrew history and the\\nreasons why Christ should be received as the Saviour of mankind. The Red\\nIndians, not liking us when we settled among them, might have been\\nwilling to fling such facts in our faces, but they were too ignorant,\\nand besides, their opinions did not signify, because we were able, if we\\nliked, to exterminate them. The Hindoos also have doubtless had their\\nrancours against us and still entertain enough ill-will to make\\nunfavourable remarks on our character, especially as to our historic\\nrapacity and arrogant notions of our own superiority; they perhaps do\\nnot admire the usual English profile, and they are not converted to our\\nway of feeding: but though we are a small number of an alien race\\nprofiting by the territory and produce of these prejudiced people, they\\nare unable to turn us out; at least, when they tried we showed them\\ntheir mistake. We do not call ourselves a dispersed and a punished\\npeople: we are a colonising people, and it is we who have punished\\nothers. Still the historian guides us rightly in urging us to dwell on the\\nvirtues of our ancestors with emulation, and to cherish our sense of a\\ncommon descent as a bond of obligation. The eminence, the nobleness of a\\npeople depends on its capability of being stirred by memories, and of\\nstriving for what we call spiritual ends--ends which consist not in\\nimmediate material possession, but in the satisfaction of a great\\nfeeling that animates the collective body as with one soul. A people\\nhaving the seed of worthiness in it must feel an answering thrill when\\nit is adjured by the deaths of its heroes who died to preserve its\\nnational existence; when it is reminded of its small beginnings and\\ngradual growth through past labours and struggles, such as are still\\ndemanded of it in order that the freedom and wellbeing thus inherited\\nmay be transmitted unimpaired to children and children\\'s children; when\\nan appeal against the permission of injustice is made to great\\nprecedents in its history and to the better genius breathing in its\\ninstitutions. It is this living force of sentiment in common which makes\\na national consciousness. Nations so moved will resist conquest with\\nthe very breasts of their women, will pay their millions and their blood\\nto abolish slavery, will share privation in famine and all calamity,\\nwill produce poets to sing \"some great story of a man,\" and thinkers\\nwhose theories will bear the test of action. An individual man, to be\\nharmoniously great, must belong to a nation of this order, if not in\\nactual existence yet existing in the past, in memory, as a departed,\\ninvisible, beloved ideal, once a reality, and perhaps to be restored. A\\ncommon humanity is not yet enough to feed the rich blood of various\\nactivity which makes a complete man. The time is not come for\\ncosmopolitanism to be highly virtuous, any more than for communism to\\nsuffice for social energy. I am not bound to feel for a Chinaman as I\\nfeel for my fellow-countryman: I am bound not to demoralise him with\\nopium, not to compel him to my will by destroying or plundering the\\nfruits of his labour on the alleged ground that he is not cosmopolitan\\nenough, and not to insult him for his want of my tailoring and religion\\nwhen he appears as a peaceable visitor on the London pavement. It is\\nadmirable in a Briton with a good purpose to learn Chinese, but it\\nwould not be a proof of fine intellect in him to taste Chinese poetry in\\nthe original more than he tastes the poetry of his own tongue. Affection, intelligence, duty, radiate from a centre, and nature has\\ndecided that for us English folk that centre can be neither China nor\\nPeru. Most of us feel this unreflectingly; for the affectation of\\nundervaluing everything native, and being too fine for one\\'s own\\ncountry, belongs only to a few minds of no dangerous leverage. What is\\nwanting is, that we should recognise a corresponding attachment to\\nnationality as legitimate in every other people, and understand that its\\nabsence is a privation of the greatest good. For, to repeat, not only the nobleness of a nation depends on the\\npresence of this national consciousness, but also the nobleness of each\\nindividual citizen. Our dignity and rectitude are proportioned to our\\nsense of relationship with something great, admirable, pregnant with\\nhigh possibilities, worthy of sacrifice, a continual inspiration to\\nself-repression and discipline by the presentation of aims larger and\\nmore attractive to our generous part than the securing of personal ease\\nor prosperity. And a people possessing this good should surely feel not\\nonly a ready sympathy with the effort of those who, having lost the\\ngood, strive to regain it, but a profound pity for any degradation\\nresulting from its loss; nay, something more than pity when happier\\nnationalities have made victims of the unfortunate whose memories\\nnevertheless are the very fountain to which the persecutors trace their\\nmost vaunted blessings. These notions are familiar: few will deny them in the abstract, and many\\nare found loudly asserting them in relation to this or the other\\nparticular case. But here as elsewhere, in the ardent application of\\nideas, there is a notable lack of simple comparison or sensibility to\\nresemblance. The European world has long been used to consider the Jews\\nas altogether exceptional, and it has followed naturally enough that\\nthey have been excepted from the rules of justice and mercy, which are\\nbased on human likeness. But to consider a people whose ideas have\\ndetermined the religion of half the world, and that the more cultivated\\nhalf, and who made the most eminent struggle against the power of Rome,\\nas a purely exceptional race, is a demoralising offence against rational\\nknowledge, a stultifying inconsistency in historical interpretation. Every nation of forcible character--i.e., of strongly marked\\ncharacteristics, is so far exceptional. The distinctive note of each\\nbird-species is in this sense exceptional, but the necessary ground of\\nsuch distinction is a deeper likeness. The superlative peculiarity in\\nthe Jews admitted, our affinity with them is only the more apparent when\\nthe elements of their peculiarity are discerned. From whatever point of view the writings of the Old Testament may be\\nregarded, the picture they present of a national development is of high\\ninterest and speciality, nor can their historic momentousness be much\\naffected by any varieties of theory as to the relation they bear to the\\nNew Testament or to the rise and constitution of Christianity. Whether\\nwe accept the canonical Hebrew books as a revelation or simply as part\\nof an ancient literature, makes no difference to the fact that we find\\nthere the strongly characterised portraiture of a people educated from\\nan earlier or later period to a sense of separateness unique in its\\nintensity, a people taught by many concurrent influences to identify\\nfaithfulness to its national traditions with the highest social and\\nreligious blessings. Our too scanty sources of Jewish history, from the\\nreturn under Ezra to the beginning of the desperate resistance against\\nRome, show us the heroic and triumphant struggle of the Maccabees, which\\nrescued the religion and independence of the nation from the corrupting\\nsway of the Syrian Greeks, adding to the glorious sum of its memorials,\\nand stimulating continuous efforts of a more peaceful sort to maintain\\nand develop that national life which the heroes had fought and died for,\\nby internal measures of legal administration and public teaching. Thenceforth the virtuous elements of the Jewish life were engaged, as\\nthey had been with varying aspects during the long and changeful\\nprophetic period and the restoration under Ezra, on the side of\\npreserving the specific national character against a demoralising fusion\\nwith that of foreigners whose religion and ritual were idolatrous and\\noften obscene. There was always a Foreign party reviling the National\\nparty as narrow, and sometimes manifesting their own breadth in\\nextensive views of advancement or profit to themselves by flattery of a\\nforeign power. Such internal conflict naturally tightened the bands of\\nconservatism, which needed to be strong if it were to rescue the sacred\\nark, the vital spirit of a small nation--\"the smallest of the\\nnations\"--whose territory lay on the highway between three continents;\\nand when the dread and hatred of foreign sway had condensed itself into\\ndread and hatred of the Romans, many Conservatives became Zealots, whose\\nchief mark was that they advocated resistance to the death against the\\nsubmergence of their nationality. Much might be said on this point\\ntowards distinguishing the desperate struggle against a conquest which\\nis regarded as degradation and corruption, from rash, hopeless\\ninsurrection against an established native government; and for my part\\n(if that were of any consequence) I share the spirit of the Zealots. I\\ntake the spectacle of the Jewish people defying the Roman edict, and\\npreferring death by starvation or the sword to the introduction of\\nCaligula\\'s deified statue into the temple, as a sublime type of\\nsteadfastness. But all that need be noticed here is the continuity of\\nthat national education (by outward and inward circumstance) which\\ncreated in the Jews a feeling of race, a sense of corporate existence,\\nunique in its intensity. But not, before the dispersion, unique in essential qualities. There is\\nmore likeness than contrast between the way we English got our island\\nand the way the Israelites got Canaan. John moved to the bedroom. We have not been noted for\\nforming a low estimate of ourselves in comparison with foreigners, or\\nfor admitting that our institutions are equalled by those of any other\\npeople under the sun. Many of us have thought that our sea-wall is a\\nspecially divine arrangement to make and keep us a nation of sea-kings\\nafter the manner of our forefathers, secure against invasion and able to\\ninvade other lands when we need them, though they may lie on the other\\nside of the ocean. Again, it has been held that we have a peculiar\\ndestiny as a Protestant people, not only able to bruise the head of an\\nidolatrous Christianity in the midst of us, but fitted as possessors of\\nthe most truth and the most tonnage to carry our purer religion over the\\nworld and convert mankind to our way of thinking. The Puritans,\\nasserting their liberty to restrain tyrants, found the Hebrew history\\nclosely symbolical of their feelings and purpose; and it can hardly be\\ncorrect to cast the blame of their less laudable doings on the writings\\nthey invoked, since their opponents made use of the same writings for\\ndifferent ends, finding there a strong warrant for the divine right of\\nkings and the denunciation of those who, like Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,\\ntook on themselves the office of the priesthood which belonged of right\\nsolely to Aaron and his sons, or, in other words, to men ordained by the\\nEnglish bishops. We must rather refer the passionate use of the Hebrew\\nwritings to affinities of disposition between our own race and the\\nJewish. Is it true that the arrogance of a Jew was so immeasurably\\nbeyond that of a Calvinist? And the just sympathy and admiration which\\nwe give to the ancestors who resisted the oppressive acts of our native\\nkings, and by resisting rescued or won for us the best part of our civil\\nand religious liberties--is it justly to be withheld from those brave\\nand steadfast men of Jewish race who fought and died, or strove by wise\\nadministration to resist, the oppression and corrupting influences of\\nforeign tyrants, and by resisting rescued the nationality which was the\\nvery hearth of our own religion? At any rate, seeing that the Jews were\\nmore specifically than any other nation educated into a sense of their\\nsupreme moral value, the chief matter of surprise is that any other\\nnation is found to rival them in this form of self-confidence. More exceptional--less like the course of our own history--has been\\ntheir dispersion and their subsistence as a separate people through ages\\nin which for the most part they were regarded and treated very much as\\nbeasts hunted for the sake of their skins, or of a valuable secretion\\npeculiar to their species. The Jews showed a talent for accumulating\\nwhat was an object of more immediate desire to Christians than animal\\noils or well-furred skins, and their cupidity and avarice were found at\\nonce particularly hateful and particularly useful: hateful when seen as\\na reason for punishing them by mulcting or robbery, useful when this\\nretributive process could be successfully carried forward. Kings and\\nemperors naturally were more alive to the usefulness of subjects who\\ncould gather and yield money; but edicts issued to protect \"the King\\'s\\nJews\" equally with the King\\'s game from being harassed and hunted by the\\ncommonalty were only slight mitigations to the deplorable lot of a race\\nheld to be under the divine curse, and had little force after the\\nCrusades began. As the slave-holders in the United States counted the\\ncurse on Ham a justification of <DW64> slavery, so the curse on the Jews\\nwas counted a justification for hindering them from pursuing agriculture\\nand handicrafts; for marking them out as execrable figures by a peculiar\\ndress; for torturing them to make them part with their gains, or for\\nmore gratuitously spitting at them and pelting them; for taking it as\\ncertain that they killed and ate babies, poisoned the wells, and took\\npains to spread the plague; for putting it to them whether they would be\\nbaptised or burned, and not failing to burn and massacre them when they\\nwere obstinate; but also for suspecting them of disliking the baptism\\nwhen they had got it, and then burning them in punishment of their\\ninsincerity; finally, for hounding them by tens on tens of thousands\\nfrom the homes where they had found shelter for centuries, and\\ninflicting on them the horrors of a new exile and a new dispersion. All\\nthis to avenge the Saviour of mankind, or else to compel these\\nstiff-necked people to acknowledge a Master whose servants showed such\\nbeneficent effects of His teaching. With a people so treated one of two issues was possible: either from\\nbeing of feebler nature than their persecutors, and caring more for ease\\nthan for the sentiments and ideas which constituted their distinctive\\ncharacter, they would everywhere give way to pressure and get rapidly\\nmerged in the populations around them; or, being endowed with uncommon\\ntenacity, physical and mental, feeling peculiarly the ties of\\ninheritance both in blood and faith, remembering national glories,\\ntrusting in their recovery, abhorring apostasy, able to bear all things\\nand hope all things with the consciousness of being steadfast to\\nspiritual obligations, the kernel of their number would harden into an\\ninflexibility more and more insured by motive and habit. They would\\ncherish all differences that marked them off from their hated\\noppressors, all memories that consoled them with a sense of virtual\\nthough unrecognised superiority; and the separateness which was made\\ntheir badge of ignominy would be their inward pride, their source of\\nfortifying defiance. Doubtless such a people would get confirmed in\\nvices. An oppressive government and a persecuting religion, while\\nbreeding vices in those who hold power, are well known to breed\\nanswering vices in those who are powerless and suffering. What more\\ndirect plan than the course presented by European history could have\\nbeen pursued in order to give the Jews a spirit of bitter isolation, of\\nscorn for the wolfish hypocrisy that made victims of them, of triumph in\\nprospering at the expense of the blunderers who stoned them away from\\nthe open paths of industry?--or, on the other hand, to encourage in the\\nless defiant a lying conformity, a pretence of conversion for the sake\\nof the social advantages attached to baptism, an outward renunciation of\\ntheir hereditary ties with the lack of real love towards the society\\nand creed which exacted this galling tribute?--or again, in the most\\nunhappy specimens of the race, to rear transcendent examples of odious\\nvice, reckless instruments of rich men with bad propensities,\\nunscrupulous grinders of the alien people who wanted to grind _them_? No wonder the Jews have their vices: no wonder if it were proved (which\\nit has not hitherto appeared to be) that some of them have a bad\\npre-eminence in evil, an unrivalled superfluity of naughtiness. It would\\nbe more plausible to make a wonder of the virtues which have prospered\\namong them under the shadow of oppression. But instead of dwelling on\\nthese, or treating as admitted what any hardy or ignorant person may\\ndeny, let us found simply on the loud assertions of the hostile. The\\nJews, it is said, resisted the expansion of their own religion into\\nChristianity; they were in the habit of spitting on the cross; they have\\nheld the name of Christ to be _Anathema_. The men\\nwho made Christianity a curse to them: the men who made the name of\\nChrist a symbol for the spirit of vengeance, and, what was worse, made\\nthe execution of the vengeance a pretext for satisfying their own\\nsavageness, greed, and envy: the men who sanctioned with the name of\\nChrist a barbaric and blundering copy of pagan fatalism in taking the\\nwords \"His blood be upon us and on our children\" as a divinely appointed\\nverbal warrant for wreaking cruelty from generation to generation on the\\npeople from whose sacred writings Christ drew His teaching. Strange\\nretrogression in the professors of an expanded religion, boasting an\\nillumination beyond the spiritual doctrine of Hebrew prophets! For\\nHebrew prophets proclaimed a God who demanded mercy rather than\\nsacrifices. The Christians also believed that God delighted not in the\\nblood of rams and of bulls, but they apparently conceived Him as\\nrequiring for His satisfaction the sighs and groans, the blood and\\nroasted flesh of men whose forefathers had misunderstood the\\nmetaphorical character of prophecies which spoke of spiritual\\npre-eminence under the figure of a material kingdom. Was this the method\\nby which Christ desired His title to the Messiahship to be commended to\\nthe hearts and understandings of the nation in which He was born? Many\\nof His sayings bear the stamp of that patriotism which places\\nfellow-countrymen in the inner circle of affection and duty. And did the\\nwords \"Father, forgive them, they know not what they do,\" refer only to\\nthe centurion and his band, a tacit exception being made of every Hebrew\\nthere present from the mercy of the Father and the compassion of the\\nSon?--nay, more, of every Hebrew yet to come who remained unconverted\\nafter hearing of His claim to the Messiahship, not from His own lips or\\nthose of His native apostles, but from the lips of alien men whom cross,\\ncreed, and baptism had left cruel, rapacious, and debauched? It is more\\nreverent to Christ to believe that He must have approved the Jewish\\nmartyrs who deliberately chose to be burned or massacred rather than be\\nguilty of a blaspheming lie, more than He approved the rabble of\\ncrusaders who robbed and murdered them in His name. But these\\nremonstrances seem to have no direct application to personages who take\\nup the attitude of philosophic thinkers and discriminating critics,\\nprofessedly accepting Christianity from a rational point of view as a\\nvehicle of the highest religious and moral truth, and condemning the\\nJews on the ground that they are obstinate adherents of an outworn\\ncreed, maintain themselves in moral alienation from the peoples with\\nwhom they share citizenship, and are destitute of real interest in the\\nwelfare of the community and state with which they are thus identified. These anti-Judaic advocates usually belong to a party which has felt\\nitself glorified in winning for Jews, as well as Dissenters and\\nCatholics, the full privileges of citizenship, laying open to them every\\npath to distinction. At one time the voice of this party urged that\\ndifferences of creed were made dangerous only by the denial of\\ncitizenship--that you must make a man a citizen before he could feel\\nlike one. At present, apparently, this confidence has been succeeded by\\na sense of mistake: there is a regret that no limiting clauses were\\ninsisted on, such as would have hindered the Jews from coming too far\\nand in too large proportion along those opened pathways; and the\\nRoumanians are thought to have shown an enviable wisdom in giving them\\nas little chance as possible. But then, the reflection occurring that\\nsome of the most objectionable Jews are baptised Christians, it is\\nobvious that such clauses would have been insufficient, and the doctrine\\nthat you can turn a Jew into a good Christian is emphatically retracted. But clearly, these liberal gentlemen, too late enlightened by\\ndisagreeable events, must yield the palm of wise foresight to those who\\nargued against them long ago; and it is a striking spectacle to witness\\nminds so panting for advancement in some directions that they are ready\\nto force it on an unwilling society, in this instance despairingly\\nrecurring to mediaeval types of thinking--insisting that the Jews are\\nmade viciously cosmopolitan by holding the world\\'s money-bag, that for\\nthem all national interests are resolved into the algebra of loans, that\\nthey have suffered an inward degradation stamping them as morally\\ninferior, and--\"serve them right,\" since they rejected Christianity. All\\nwhich is mirrored in an analogy, namely, that of the Irish, also a\\nservile race, who have rejected Protestantism though it has been\\nrepeatedly urged on them by fire and sword and penal laws, and whose\\nplace in the moral scale may be judged by our advertisements, where the\\nclause, \"No Irish need apply,\" parallels the sentence which for many\\npolite persons sums up the question of Judaism--\"I never _did_ like the\\nJews.\" It is certainly worth considering whether an expatriated, denationalised\\nrace, used for ages to live among antipathetic populations, must not\\ninevitably lack some conditions of nobleness. If they drop that\\nseparateness which is made their reproach, they may be in danger of\\nlapsing into a cosmopolitan indifference equivalent to cynicism, and of\\nmissing that inward identification with the nationality immediately\\naround them which might make some amends for their inherited privation. No dispassionate observer can deny this danger. Why, our own countrymen\\nwho take to living abroad without purpose or function to keep up their\\nsense of fellowship in the affairs of their own land are rarely good\\nspecimens of moral healthiness; still, the consciousness of having a\\nnative country, the birthplace of common memories and habits of mind,\\nexisting like a parental hearth quitted but beloved; the dignity of\\nbeing included in a people which has a part in the comity of nations\\nand the growing federation of the world; that sense of special belonging\\nwhich is the root of human virtues, both public and private,--all these\\nspiritual links may preserve migratory Englishmen from the worst\\nconsequences of their voluntary dispersion. Unquestionably the Jews,\\nhaving been more than any other race exposed to the adverse moral\\ninfluences of alienism, must, both in individuals and in groups, have\\nsuffered some corresponding moral degradation; but in fact they have\\nescaped with less of abjectness and less of hard hostility towards the\\nnations whose hand has been against them, than could have happened in\\nthe case of a people who had neither their adhesion to a separate\\nreligion founded on historic memories, nor their characteristic family\\naffectionateness. Tortured, flogged, spit upon, the _corpus vile_ on\\nwhich rage or wantonness vented themselves with impunity, their name\\nflung at them as an opprobrium by superstition, hatred, and contempt,\\nthey have remained proud of their origin. Does any one call this an evil\\npride? Perhaps he belongs to that order of man who, while he has a\\ndemocratic dislike to dukes and earls, wants to make believe that his\\nfather was an idle gentleman, when in fact he was an honourable artisan,\\nor who would feel flattered to be taken for other than an Englishman. It\\nis possible to be too arrogant about our blood or our calling, but that\\narrogance is virtue compared with such mean pretence. The pride which\\nidentifies us with a great historic body is a humanising, elevating\\nhabit of mind, inspiring sacrifices of individual comfort, gain, or\\nother selfish ambition, for the sake of that ideal whole; and no man\\nswayed by such a sentiment can become completely abject. That a Jew of\\nSmyrna, where a whip is carried by passengers ready to flog off the too\\nofficious specimens of his race, can still be proud to say, \"I am a\\nJew,\" is surely a fact to awaken admiration in a mind capable of\\nunderstanding what we may call the ideal forces in human history. And\\nagain, a varied, impartial observation of the Jews in different\\ncountries tends to the impression that they have a predominant\\nkindliness which must have been deeply ingrained in the constitution of\\ntheir race to have outlasted the ages of persecution and oppression. The concentration of their joys in domestic life has kept up in them the\\ncapacity of tenderness: the pity for the fatherless and the widow, the\\ncare for the women and the little ones, blent intimately with their\\nreligion, is a well of mercy that cannot long or widely be pent up by\\nexclusiveness. And the kindliness of the Jew overflows the line of\\ndivision between him and the Gentile. On the whole, one of the most\\nremarkable phenomena in the history of this scattered people, made for\\nages \"a scorn and a hissing\" is, that after being subjected to this\\nprocess, which might have been expected to be in every sense\\ndeteriorating and vitiating, they have come out of it (in any estimate\\nwhich allows for numerical proportion) rivalling the nations of all\\nEuropean countries in healthiness and beauty of _physique_, in practical\\nability, in scientific and artistic aptitude, and in some forms of\\nethical value. A significant indication of their natural rank is seen in\\nthe fact that at this moment, the leader of the Liberal party in Germany\\nis a Jew, the leader of the Republican party in France is a Jew, and the\\nhead of the Conservative ministry in England is a Jew. And here it is\\nthat we find the ground for the obvious jealousy which is now\\nstimulating the revived expression of old antipathies. \"The Jews,\" it is\\nfelt, \"have a dangerous tendency to get the uppermost places not only in\\ncommerce but in political life. Their monetary hold on governments is\\ntending to perpetuate in leading Jews a spirit of universal alienism\\n(euphemistically called cosmopolitanism), even where the West has given\\nthem a full share in civil and political rights. A people with oriental\\nsunlight in their blood, yet capable of being everywhere acclimatised,\\nthey have a force and toughness which enables them to carry off the best\\nprizes; and their wealth is likely to put half the seats in Parliament\\nat their disposal.\" There is truth in these views of Jewish social and political relations. But it is rather too late for liberal pleaders to urge them in a merely\\nvituperative sense. Do they propose as a remedy for the impending danger\\nof our healthier national influences getting overridden by Jewish\\npredominance, that we should repeal our emancipatory laws? Not all the\\nGermanic immigrants who have been settling among us for generations,\\nand are still pouring in to settle, are Jews, but thoroughly Teutonic\\nand more or less Christian craftsmen, mechanicians, or skilled and\\nerudite functionaries; and the Semitic Christians who swarm among us are\\ndangerously like their unconverted brethren in complexion, persistence,\\nand wealth. Then there are the Greeks who, by the help of Phoenician\\nblood or otherwise, are objectionably strong in the city. Some judges\\nthink that the Scotch are more numerous and prosperous here in the South\\nthan is quite for the good of us Southerners; and the early\\ninconvenience felt under the Stuarts of being quartered upon by a\\nhungry, hard-working people with a distinctive accent and form of\\nreligion, and higher cheek-bones than English taste requires, has not\\nyet been quite neutralised. As for the Irish, it is felt in high\\nquarters that we have always been too lenient towards them;--at least,\\nif they had been harried a little more there might not have been so many\\nof them on the English press, of which they divide the power with the\\nScotch, thus driving many Englishmen to honest and ineloquent labour. So far shall we be carried if we go in search of devices to hinder\\npeople of other blood than our own from getting the advantage of\\ndwelling among us. Let it be admitted that it is a calamity to the English, as to any other\\ngreat historic people, to undergo a premature fusion with immigrants of\\nalien blood; that its distinctive national characteristics should be in\\ndanger of obliteration by the predominating quality of foreign settlers. I not only admit this, I am ready to unite in groaning over the\\nthreatened danger. To one who loves his native language, who would\\ndelight to keep our rich and harmonious English undefiled by foreign\\naccent, foreign intonation, and those foreign tinctures of verbal\\nmeaning which tend to confuse all writing and discourse, it is an\\naffliction as harassing as the climate, that on our stage, in our\\nstudios, at our public and private gatherings, in our offices,\\nwarehouses, and workshops, we must expect to hear our beloved English\\nwith its words clipped, its vowels stretched and twisted, its phrases of\\nacquiescence and politeness, of cordiality, dissidence or argument,\\ndelivered always in the wrong tones, like ill-rendered melodies, marred\\nbeyond recognition; that there should be a general ambition to speak\\nevery language except our mother English, which persons \"of style\" are\\nnot ashamed of corrupting with slang, false foreign equivalents, and a\\npronunciation that crushes out all colour from the vowels and jams them\\nbetween jostling consonants. An ancient Greek might not like to be\\nresuscitated for the sake of hearing Homer read in our universities,\\nstill he would at least find more instructive marvels in other\\ndevelopments to be witnessed at those institutions; but a modern\\nEnglishman is invited from his after-dinner repose to hear Shakspere\\ndelivered under circumstances which offer no other novelty than some\\nnovelty of false intonation, some new distribution of strong emphasis on\\nprepositions, some new misconception of a familiar idiom. it is\\nour inertness that is in fault, our carelessness of excellence, our\\nwilling ignorance of the treasures that lie in our national heritage,\\nwhile we are agape after what is foreign, though it may be only a vile\\nimitation of what is native. This marring of our speech, however, is a minor evil compared with what\\nmust follow from the predominance of wealth--acquiring immigrants, whose\\nappreciation of our political and social life must often be as\\napproximative or fatally erroneous as their delivery of our language. But take the worst issues--what can we do to hinder them? Are we to\\nadopt the exclusiveness for which we have punished the Chinese? Are we\\nto tear the glorious flag of hospitality which has made our freedom the\\nworld-wide blessing of the oppressed? It is not agreeable to find\\nforeign accents and stumbling locutions passing from the piquant\\nexception to the general rule of discourse. But to urge on that account\\nthat we should spike away the peaceful foreigner, would be a view of\\ninternational relations not in the long-run favourable to the interests\\nof our fellow-countrymen; for we are at least equal to the races we call\\nobtrusive in the disposition to settle wherever money is to be made and\\ncheaply idle living to be found. In meeting the national evils which are\\nbrought upon us by the onward course of the world, there is often no\\nmore immediate hope or resource than that of striving after fuller\\nnational excellence, which must consist in the moulding of more\\nexcellent individual natives. The tendency of things is towards the\\nquicker or slower fusion of races. It is impossible to arrest this\\ntendency: all we can do is to moderate its course so as to hinder it\\nfrom degrading the moral status of societies by a too rapid effacement\\nof those national traditions and customs which are the language of the\\nnational genius--the deep suckers of healthy sentiment. Such moderating\\nand guidance of inevitable movement is worthy of all effort. And it is\\nin this sense that the modern insistance on the idea of Nationalities\\nhas value. That any people at once distinct and coherent enough to form\\na state should be held in subjection by an alien antipathetic government\\nhas been becoming more and more a ground of sympathetic indignation; and\\nin virtue of this, at least one great State has been added to European\\ncouncils. Nobody now complains of the result in this case, though\\nfar-sighted persons see the need to limit analogy by discrimination. We\\nhave to consider who are the stifled people and who the stiflers before\\nwe can be sure of our ground. The only point in this connection on which Englishmen are agreed is,\\nthat England itself shall not be subject to foreign rule. The fiery\\nresolve to resist invasion, though with an improvised array of\\npitchforks, is felt to be virtuous, and to be worthy of a historic\\npeople. Because there is a national life in our veins. Because\\nthere is something specifically English which we feel to be supremely\\nworth striving for, worth dying for, rather than living to renounce it. Because we too have our share--perhaps a principal share--in that spirit\\nof separateness which has not yet done its work in the education of\\nmankind, which has created the varying genius of nations, and, like the\\nMuses, is the offspring of memory. Here, as everywhere else, the human task seems to be the discerning and\\nadjustment of opposite claims. But the end can hardly be achieved by\\nurging contradictory reproaches, and instead of labouring after\\ndiscernment as a preliminary to intervention, letting our zeal burst\\nforth according to a capricious selection, first determined accidentally\\nand afterwards justified by personal predilection. Not only John Gilpin\\nand his wife, or Edwin and Angelina, seem to be of opinion that their\\npreference or dislike of Russians, Servians, or Greeks, consequent,\\nperhaps, on hotel adventures, has something to do with the merits of the\\nEastern Question; even in a higher range of intellect and enthusiasm we\\nfind a distribution of sympathy or pity for sufferers of different blood\\nor votaries of differing religions, strangely unaccountable on any other\\nground than a fortuitous direction of study or trivial circumstances of\\ntravel. With some even admirable persons, one is never quite sure of any\\nparticular being included under a general term. A provincial physician,\\nit is said, once ordering a lady patient not to eat salad, was asked\\npleadingly by the affectionate husband whether she might eat lettuce, or\\ncresses, or radishes. The physician had too rashly believed in the\\ncomprehensiveness of the word \"salad,\" just as we, if not enlightened by\\nexperience, might believe in the all-embracing breadth of \"sympathy with\\nthe injured and oppressed.\" What mind can exhaust the grounds of\\nexception which lie in each particular case? There is understood to be a\\npeculiar odour from the <DW64> body, and we know that some persons, too\\nrationalistic to feel bound by the curse on Ham, used to hint very\\nstrongly that this odour determined the question on the side of <DW64>\\nslavery. And this is the usual level of thinking in polite society concerning the\\nJews. Apart from theological purposes, it seems to be held surprising\\nthat anybody should take an interest in the history of a people whose\\nliterature has furnished all our devotional language; and if any\\nreference is made to their past or future destinies some hearer is sure\\nto state as a relevant fact which may assist our judgment, that she, for\\nher part, is not fond of them, having known a Mr Jacobson who was very\\nunpleasant, or that he, for his part, thinks meanly of them as a race,\\nthough on inquiry you find that he is so little acquainted with their\\ncharacteristics that he is astonished to learn how many persons whom he\\nhas blindly admired and applauded are Jews to the backbone. Again, men\\nwho consider themselves in the very van of modern advancement, knowing\\nhistory and the latest philosophies of history, indicate their\\ncontemptuous surprise that any one should entertain the destiny of the\\nJews as a worthy subject, by referring to Moloch and their own\\nagreement with the theory that the religion of Jehovah was merely a\\ntransformed Moloch-worship, while in the same breath they are glorifying\\n\"civilisation\" as a transformed tribal existence of which some\\nlineaments are traceable in grim marriage customs of the native\\nAustralians. Are these erudite persons prepared to insist that the name\\n\"Father\" should no longer have any sanctity for us, because in their\\nview of likelihood our Aryan ancestors were mere improvers on a state of\\nthings in which nobody knew his own father? For less theoretic men, ambitious, to be regarded as practical\\npoliticians, the value of the Hebrew race has been measured by their\\nunfavourable opinion of a prime minister who is a Jew by lineage. But it\\nis possible to form a very ugly opinion as to the scrupulousness of\\nWalpole or of Chatham; and in any case I think Englishmen would refuse\\nto accept the character and doings of those eighteenth century statesmen\\nas the standard of value for the English people and the part they have\\nto play in the fortunes of mankind. If we are to consider the future of the Jews at all, it seems\\nreasonable to take as a preliminary question: Are they destined to\\ncomplete fusion with the peoples among whom they are dispersed, losing\\nevery remnant of a distinctive consciousness as Jews; or, are there in\\nthe breadth and intensity with which the feeling of separateness, or\\nwhat we may call the organised memory of a national consciousness,\\nactually exists in the world-wide Jewish communities--the seven millions\\nscattered from east to west--and again, are there in the political\\nrelations of the world, the conditions present or approaching for the\\nrestoration of a Jewish state planted on the old ground as a centre of\\nnational feeling, a source of dignifying protection, a special channel\\nfor special energies which may contribute some added form of national\\ngenius, and an added voice in the councils of the world? They are among us everywhere: it is useless to say we are not fond of\\nthem. Perhaps we are not fond of proletaries and their tendency to form\\nUnions, but the world is not therefore to be rid of them. If we wish to\\nfree ourselves from the inconveniences that we have to complain of,\\nwhether in proletaries or in Jews, our best course is to encourage all\\nmeans of improving these neighbours who elbow us in a thickening crowd,\\nand of sending their incommodious energies into beneficent channels. Why\\nare we so eager for the dignity of certain populations of whom perhaps\\nwe have never seen a single specimen, and of whose history, legend, or\\nliterature we have been contentedly ignorant for ages, while we sneer at\\nthe notion of a renovated national dignity for the Jews, whose ways of\\nthinking and whose very verbal forms are on our lips in every prayer\\nwhich we end with an Amen? Some of us consider this question dismissed\\nwhen they have said that the wealthiest Jews have no desire to forsake\\ntheir European palaces, and go to live in Jerusalem. But in a return\\nfrom exile, in the restoration of a people, the question is not whether\\ncertain rich men will choose to remain behind, but whether there will be\\nfound worthy men who will choose to lead the return. Plenty of\\nprosperous Jews remained in Babylon when Ezra marshalled his band of\\nforty thousand and began a new glorious epoch in the history of his\\nrace, making the preparation for that epoch in the history of the world\\nwhich has been held glorious enough to be dated from for evermore. The\\nhinge of possibility is simply the existence of an adequate community of\\nfeeling as well as widespread need in the Jewish race, and the hope that\\namong its finer specimens there may arise some men of instruction and\\nardent public spirit, some new Ezras, some modern Maccabees, who will\\nknow how to use all favouring outward conditions, how to triumph by\\nheroic example, over the indifference of their fellows and the scorn of\\ntheir foes, and will steadfastly set their faces towards making their\\npeople once more one among the nations. Formerly, evangelical orthodoxy was prone to dwell on the fulfilment of\\nprophecy in the \"restoration of the Jews,\" Such interpretation of the\\nprophets is less in vogue now. The dominant mode is to insist on a\\nChristianity that disowns its origin, that is not a substantial growth\\nhaving a genealogy, but is a vaporous reflex of modern notions. The\\nChrist of Matthew had the heart of a Jew--\"Go ye first to the lost\\nsheep of the house of Israel.\" The Apostle of the Gentiles had the heart\\nof a Jew: \"For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my\\nbrethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh: who are Israelites; to whom\\npertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the\\ngiving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises; whose are\\nthe fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came.\" Modern\\napostles, extolling Christianity, are found using a different tone: they\\nprefer the mediaeval cry translated into modern phrase. But the\\nmediaeval cry too was in substance very ancient--more ancient than the\\ndays of Augustus. Pagans in successive ages said, \"These people are\\nunlike us, and refuse to be made like us: let us punish them.\" The Jews\\nwere steadfast in their separateness, and through that separateness\\nChristianity was born. A modern book on Liberty has maintained that from\\nthe freedom of individual men to persist in idiosyncrasies the world may\\nbe enriched. Why should we not apply this argument to the idiosyncrasy\\nof a nation, and pause in our haste to hoot it down? There is still a\\ngreat function for the steadfastness of the Jew: not that he should\\nshut out the utmost illumination which knowledge can throw on his\\nnational history, but that he should cherish the store of inheritance\\nwhich that history has left him. Every Jew should be conscious that he\\nis one of a multitude possessing common objects of piety in the immortal\\nachievements and immortal sorrows of ancestors who have transmitted to\\nthem a physical and mental type strong enough, eminent enough in\\nfaculties, pregnant enough with peculiar promise, to constitute a new\\nbeneficent individuality among the nations, and, by confuting the\\ntraditions of scorn, nobly avenge the wrongs done to their Fathers. There is a sense in which the worthy child of a nation that has brought\\nforth illustrious prophets, high and unique among the poets of the\\nworld, is bound by their visions. Yes, for the effective bond of human action is feeling, and the worthy\\nchild of a people owning the triple name of Hebrew, Israelite, and Jew,\\nfeels his kinship with the glories and the sorrows, the degradation and\\nthe possible renovation of his national family. Will any one teach the nullification of this feeling and call his\\ndoctrine a philosophy? He will teach a blinding superstition--the\\nsuperstition that a theory of human wellbeing can be constructed in\\ndisregard of the influences which have made us human. Hopps earned the ill-will of the Glen for ever by criticising\\nthe doctor\\'s dress, but indeed it would have filled any townsman with\\namazement. Black he wore once a year, on Sacrament Sunday, and, if\\npossible, at a funeral; topcoat or waterproof never. His jacket and\\nwaistcoat were rough homespun of Glen Urtach wool, which threw off the\\nwet like a duck\\'s back, and below he was clad in shepherd\\'s tartan\\ntrousers, which disappeared into unpolished riding boots. His shirt was\\ngrey flannel, and he was uncertain about a collar, but certain as to a\\ntie which he never had, his beard doing instead, and his hat was soft\\nfelt of four colors and seven different shapes. His point of distinction\\nin dress was the trousers, and they were the subject of unending\\nspeculation. \"Some threep that he\\'s worn thae eedentical pair the last twenty year,\\nan\\' a\\' mind masel him gettin\\' a tear ahint, when he was crossin\\' oor\\npalin\\', and the mend\\'s still veesible. \"Ithers declare \\'at he\\'s got a wab o\\' claith, and hes a new pair made in\\nMuirtown aince in the twa year maybe, and keeps them in the garden till\\nthe new look wears aff. \"For ma ain pairt,\" Soutar used to declare, \"a\\' canna mak up my mind,\\nbut there\\'s ae thing sure, the Glen wud not like tae see him withoot\\nthem: it wud be a shock tae confidence. There\\'s no muckle o\\' the check\\nleft, but ye can aye tell it, and when ye see thae breeks comin\\' in ye\\nken that if human pooer can save yir bairn\\'s life it \\'ill be dune.\" The confidence of the Glen--and tributary states--was unbounded, and\\nrested partly on long experience of the doctor\\'s resources, and partly\\non his hereditary connection. \"His father was here afore him,\" Mrs. Macfadyen used to explain; \"atween\\nthem they\\'ve hed the countyside for weel on tae a century; if MacLure\\ndisna understand oor constitution, wha dis, a\\' wud like tae ask?\" For Drumtochty had its own constitution and a special throat disease, as\\nbecame a parish which was quite self-contained between the woods and the\\nhills, and not dependent on the lowlands either for its diseases or its\\ndoctors. \"He\\'s a skilly man, Doctor MacLure,\" continued my friend Mrs. Macfayden,\\nwhose judgment on sermons or anything else was seldom at fault; \"an\\'\\na kind-hearted, though o\\' coorse he hes his faults like us a\\', an\\' he\\ndisna tribble the Kirk often. \"He aye can tell what\\'s wrang wi\\' a body, an\\' maistly he can put ye\\nricht, and there\\'s nae new-fangled wys wi\\' him: a blister for the\\nootside an\\' Epsom salts for the inside dis his wark, an\\' they say\\nthere\\'s no an herb on the hills he disna ken. \"If we\\'re tae dee, we\\'re tae dee; an\\' if we\\'re tae live, we\\'re tae live,\"\\nconcluded Elspeth, with sound Calvinistic logic; \"but a\\'ll say this\\nfor the doctor, that whether yir tae live or dee, he can aye keep up a\\nsharp meisture on the skin.\" \"But he\\'s no veera ceevil gin ye bring him when there\\'s naethin\\' wrang,\"\\nand Mrs. Macfayden\\'s face reflected another of Mr. Hopps\\' misadventures\\nof which Hillocks held the copyright. \"Hopps\\' laddie ate grosarts (gooseberries) till they hed to sit up a\\'\\nnicht wi\\' him, an\\' naethin\\' wud do but they maun hae the doctor, an\\' he\\nwrites \\'immediately\\' on a slip o\\' paper. \"Weel, MacLure had been awa a\\' nicht wi\\' a shepherd\\'s wife Dunleith wy,\\nand he comes here withoot drawin\\' bridle, mud up tae the cen. \"\\'What\\'s a dae here, Hillocks?\" he cries; \\'it\\'s no an accident, is\\'t?\\' and when he got aff his horse he cud hardly stand wi\\' stiffness and\\ntire. \"\\'It\\'s nane o\\' us, doctor; it\\'s Hopps\\' laddie; he\\'s been eatin\\' ower\\nmony berries.\\' [Illustration: \"HOPPS\\' LADDIE ATE GROSARTS\"]\\n\\n\"If he didna turn on me like a tiger. \"<DW37> ye mean tae say----\\'\\n\\n\"\\'Weesht, weesht,\\' an\\' I tried tae quiet him, for Hopps wes comin\\' oot. \"\\'Well, doctor,\\' begins he, as brisk as a magpie, \\'you\\'re here at last;\\nthere\\'s no hurry with you Scotchmen.

       "'\\nwhich remind us of days far earlier. Edward the Fourth and Richard the\\nThird were chosen Kings, or at least had their claims to the Crown\\nacknowledged, by gatherings of the citizens of London which remind us\\nof the wars of Stephen and Matilda(59). Still even in this age, the\\npower of Parliament was advancing(60); the anxiety of every pretender\\nto get a parliamentary sanction for his claims was a sign of the\\ngrowing importance of Parliament, and we get incidental notices which\\nshow that a seat in the House of Commons, and that not as a knight of a\\nshire, but as a burgess of a borough, was now an object of ambition for\\nmen of the class from which knights of the shire were chosen, and even\\nfor the sons of members of the Upper House(61). At last came the sixteenth century, the time of trial for parliamentary\\ninstitutions in so many countries of Europe. Daniel travelled to the kitchen. Not a few assemblies which\\nhad once been as free as our own Parliament were, during that age,\\neither utterly swept away or reduced to empty formalities. Then it\\nwas that Charles the Fifth and Philip the Second overthrew the free\\nconstitutions of Castile and Aragon; before long the States-General\\nof France met for the last time before their last meeting of all\\non the eve of the great Revolution(62). In England parliamentary\\ninstitutions were not swept away, nor did Parliament sink into an empty\\nform. But, for a while, Parliaments, like all our other institutions,\\nbecame perverted into instruments of tyranny. Under Henry the Eighth,\\nParliaments, like Judges, Juries, and ecclesiastical Synods, decreed\\nwhatever seemed good to the caprice of the despot. Why had they so\\nfallen away from what they had been in a past age, from what they\\nwere to be again? The reason is plain; the Commons had not yet gained\\nstrength enough to act without the Lords, and the Lords had ceased to\\nbe an independent body. The old nobility had been cut off at Towton\\nand Barnet, and the new nobility were the abject slaves of the King\\nto whom they owed their honours. A century later, the new nobility\\nhad inherited the spirit of the old, and the Commons had grown to the\\nfulness of their power. Thus it came that we find in the Parliaments\\nof the sixteenth century an abject submission to a tyrant’s will, of\\nwhich we find no sign in the Parliaments either of the fourteenth or\\nof the seventeenth. Very different indeed from the Parliaments which\\noverthrew Richard the Second and Charles the First were the Parliaments\\nwhich, almost without a question, passed bills of attainder against\\nany man against whom Henry’s caprice had turned, the Parliaments\\nwhich, in the great age of religious controversy, were ever ready\\nto enforce by every penalty that particular shade of doctrine which\\nfor the moment commended itself to the Defender of the Faith, to his\\nson or to his daughters. Why, it may be asked, in such a state of\\nthings, did not parliamentary institutions perish in England as they\\nperished in so many other lands? It might be enough to say that no\\nruler had an interest in destroying institutions which he found that\\nhe could so conveniently turn to his own purposes. But why did not\\nthose institutions sink into mere forms, which they certainly did not\\ndo, even in the worst times? One reason undoubtedly is that special\\ninsular position of our country which has in so many other ways\\ngiven a peculiar turn to our history. The great foe of parliamentary\\ninstitutions was the introduction of standing armies. But the sovereign\\nof England, shut up within his island, had far less need of a standing\\narmy than the sovereigns of the Continent, engaged as they were in\\ntheir ceaseless wars with neighbours on their frontiers. But I believe\\nthat the personal character of Henry the Eighth had a great deal to\\ndo with the final preservation of our liberties. Do not for a moment\\nfancy that I belong to that school of paradox which sets up Henry the\\nEighth as a virtuous and beneficent ruler. Do not think that I claim\\nfor him any feelings of direct thankfulness such as I do claim for\\nEarl Simon and King Edward. The position of Henry is more like the\\nposition of William the Conqueror, though I certainly hold that the\\nConqueror was in everything the better man of the two. Both served the\\ncause of freedom indirectly, and both served it by means of features\\nin the personal character of each. In one respect indeed William and\\nHenry stood in utterly different positions towards England. William was\\na stranger, and it was largely because he was a stranger that he was\\nable to do us indirect good. Henry, with all his crimes, was a thorough\\nEnglishman; throughout his reign there was a sympathy between him and\\nthe mass of his subjects, who, after all, did not greatly suffer by the\\noccasional beheading of a Queen or a Duke. But the despotism of William\\nand the despotism of Henry agreed in this, that each, even in his worst\\ndeeds, retained a scrupulous regard for the letter of the Law. Sandra went back to the bathroom. In the\\ncase of William this is not hard to see for any one who carefully\\nstudies the records of his age(63); in the case of Henry it stands\\nboldly proclaimed in the broadest facts of English history. While his\\nfellow-tyrants abroad were everywhere overthrowing free institutions,\\nHenry was in all things showing them the deepest outward respect. Throughout his reign he took care to do nothing except in outward and\\nregular legal form, nothing for which he could not shelter himself\\nunder the sanction either of precedent or of written Law. In itself,\\nthis perversion of Law, this clothing of wrong with the garb of right,\\nis really worse—at all events it is more corrupting—than deeds of open\\nviolence against which men are tempted openly to revolt. But such a\\ntyranny as Henry’s is one form of the homage which vice pays to virtue;\\nthe careful preservation of the outward forms of freedom makes it\\neasier for another and happier generation again to kindle the form into\\nits ancient spirit and life. Every deed of wrong done by Henry with the\\nassent of Parliament was in truth a witness to the abiding importance\\nof Parliament; the very degradation of our ancient Constitution was a\\nstep to its revival with new strength and in a more perfect form(64). A like witness to the importance of Parliament in this age was shown\\nin two other very remarkable ways, whereby the power and importance of\\nthe House of Commons was acknowledged in the very act of corrupting\\nit. Sandra went to the kitchen. One was the active interference of the Government in parliamentary\\nelections; the other was the creation of boroughs in order to be\\ncorrupt. One needs no stronger proofs than these of the importance\\nof the body which it was found needful thus to pack and to manage. The Crown still kept the power of summoning members from any boroughs\\nwhich it thought fit, and throughout the Tudor reigns the power was\\nfreely abused by sending writs to places which were likely to return\\nmembers who would be subservient to the Court(65). Thus arose many\\nof the wretched little boroughs in Cornwall and elsewhere which were\\ndisfranchised by our successive Reform Bills. These boroughs, which\\nalways were corrupt and which were created in order to be corrupt, must\\nbe carefully distinguished from another class which perished with them. Many towns to which Earl Simon and King Edward sent writs decayed in\\nprocess of time; sometimes they decayed positively; more commonly they\\ndecayed relatively, by being utterly outstripped by younger towns and\\nso losing the importance which they had once had. The disfranchisement\\nof both classes was equally just; but the different history of the two\\nclasses should be carefully borne in mind. It was right to take away\\nits members from Old Sarum, but there had been a time when it was right\\nto give Old Sarum members. In the case of a crowd of Cornish boroughs,\\nit not only was right to take away their members, but they never ought\\nto have had members at all(66). It was in the days of Elizabeth that something of the ancient spirit\\nagain breathed forth. It is then that we come to the beginning of that\\nlong line of parliamentary worthies which stretches on in unbroken\\norder from her days to our own. A few daring spirits in the Commons’\\nHouse now began once more to speak in tones worthy of those great\\nAssemblies which had taught the Edwards and the Richards that there\\nwas a power in England mightier than their own(67). Under the puny\\nsuccessor of the great Queen the voice of freedom was heard more\\nloudly(68). In the next reign the great strife of all came, and a King\\nof England once more, as in the days of Henry and Simon, stood forth\\nin arms against his people to learn that the power of his people was\\na greater power than his. But in the seventeenth century, just as in\\nthe thirteenth, men did not ask for any rights and powers which were\\nadmitted to be new; they asked only for the better security of those\\nrights and powers which had been handed on from days of old.

       "'If all this effort and\\nexpenditure had resulted in success, it would be possible to keep\\nsilent and shrug one\\'s shoulders; but when the mode of undertaking\\nthis expedition can be clearly shown to have been the direct cause of\\nits failure, silence would be a crime. When Lord Wolseley told the\\nsoldiers at Korti on their return from Metemmah, \"It was not _your_\\nfault that Gordon has perished and Khartoum fallen,\" the positiveness\\nof his assurance may have been derived from the inner conviction of\\nhis own stupendous error. The expedition was finally sanctioned in August, and the news of its\\ncoming was known to General Gordon in September, before, indeed, his\\nown despatches of 31st July were received in London, and broke the\\nsuspense of nearly half a year. He thought that only a small force was\\ncoming, under the command of Major-General Earle, and he at once, as\\nalready described, sent his steamers back to Shendy, there to await\\nthe troops and convey them to Khartoum. He seems to have calculated\\nthat three months from the date of the message informing him of the\\nexpedition would suffice for the conveyance of the troops as far as\\nBerber or Metemmah, and at that rate General Earle would have arrived\\nwhere his steamers awaited him early in November. Sandra moved to the kitchen. Gordon\\'s views as to\\nthe object of the expedition, which somebody called the Gordon Relief\\nExpedition, were thus clearly expressed:--\\n\\n     \"I altogether decline the imputation that the projected\\n     expedition has come to relieve me. It has come to save our\\n     National honour in extricating the garrisons, etc., from a\\n     position in which our action in Egypt has placed these garrisons. As for myself, I could make good my retreat at any moment, if I\\n     wished. Now realise what would happen if this first relief\\n     expedition was to bolt, and the steamers fell into the hands of\\n     the Mahdi. This second relief expedition (for the honour of\\n     England engaged in extricating garrisons) would be somewhat\\n     hampered. We, the first and second expeditions, are equally\\n     engaged for the honour of England. I came up\\n     to extricate the garrison, and failed. Earle comes up to\\n     extricate garrisons, and I hope succeeds. Earle does not come to\\n     extricate me. The extrication of the garrisons was supposed to\\n     affect our \"National honour.\" If Earle succeeds, the \"National\\n     honour\" thanks him, and I hope recommends him, but it is\\n     altogether independent of me, who, for failing, incurs its blame. I am not _the rescued lamb_, and I will not be.\" Lord Wolseley, still possessed with the idea that, now that an\\nexpedition had been sanctioned, the question of time was not of\\nsupreme importance, and that the relieving expedition might be carried\\nout in a deliberate manner, which would be both more effective and\\nless exposed to risk, did not reach Cairo till September, and had only\\narrived at Wady Halfa on 8th October, when his final instructions\\nreached him in the following form:--\"The primary object of your\\nexpedition is to bring away General Gordon and Colonel Stewart, and\\nyou are not to advance further south than necessary to attain that\\nobject, and when it has been secured, no further offensive operations\\nof any kind are to be undertaken.\" It had,\\nhowever, determined to leave the garrisons to their fate, despite the\\nNational honour being involved, at the very moment that it sanctioned\\nan enormous expenditure to try and save the lives of its\\nlong-neglected representatives, Gordon and Colonel Stewart. With\\nextraordinary shrewdness, Gordon detected the hollowness of its\\npurpose, and wrote:--\"I very much doubt what is really going to be the\\npolicy of our Government, even now that the Expedition is at Dongola,\"\\nand if they intend ratting out, \"the troops had better not come beyond\\nBerber till the question of what will be done is settled.\" The receipt of Gordon\\'s and Power\\'s despatches of July showed that\\nthere were, at the time of their being written, supplies for four\\nmonths, which would have carried the garrison on till the end of\\nNovember. As the greater part of that period had expired when these\\ndocuments reached Lord Wolseley\\'s hands, it was quite impossible to\\ndoubt that time had become the most important factor of all in the\\nsituation. The chance of being too late would even then have presented\\nitself to a prudent commander, and, above all, to a friend hastening\\nto the rescue of a friend. The news that Colonel Stewart and some\\nother Europeans had been entrapped and murdered near Merowe, which\\nreached the English commander from different sources before Gordon\\nconfirmed it in his letters, was also calculated to stimulate, by\\nshowing that Gordon was alone, and had single-handed to conduct the\\ndefence of a populous city. Hard on the heels of that intelligence\\ncame Gordon\\'s letter of 4th November to Lord Wolseley, who received it\\nat Dongola on 14th of the same month. The letter was a long one, but\\nonly two passages need be quoted:--\"At Metemmah, waiting your orders,\\nare five steamers with nine guns.\" Did it not occur to anyone how\\ngreatly, at the worst stage of the siege, Gordon had thus weakened\\nhimself to assist the relieving expedition? Even for that reason there\\nwas not a day or an hour to be lost. But the letter contained a worse and more alarming passage:--\"We can\\nhold out forty days with ease; after that it will be difficult.\" Forty\\ndays would have meant till 14th December, one month ahead of the day\\nLord Wolseley received the news, but the message was really more\\nalarming than the form in which it was published, for there is no\\ndoubt that the word \"difficult\" is the official rendering of Gordon\\'s,\\na little indistinctly written, word \"desperate.\" In face of that\\nalarming message, which only stated facts that ought to have been\\nsurmised, if not known, it was no longer possible to pursue the\\nleisurely promenade up the Nile, which was timed so as to bring the\\nwhole force to Khartoum in the first week of March. Rescue by the most\\nprominent general and swell troops of England at Easter would hardly\\ngratify the commandant and garrison starved into surrender the\\nprevious Christmas, and that was the exact relationship between\\nWolseley\\'s plans and Gordon\\'s necessities. The date at which Gordon\\'s supplies would be exhausted varied not from\\nany miscalculation, but because on two successive occasions he\\ndiscovered large stores of grain and biscuits, which had been stolen\\nfrom the public granaries before his arrival. The supplies that would\\nall have disappeared in November were thus eked out, first till the\\nmiddle of December, and then finally till the end of January, but\\nthere is no doubt that they would not have lasted as long as they did\\nif in the last month of the siege he had not given the civil\\npopulation permission to leave the doomed town. From any and from\\nevery point of view, there was not the shadow of an excuse for a\\nmoment\\'s delay after the receipt of that letter on 14th November. With the British Exchequer at a commander\\'s back, it is easy to\\norganise an expedition on an elaborate scale, and to carry it out with\\nthe nicety of perfection, but for the realisation of these ponderous\\nplans there is one thing more necessary, and that is time. I have no\\ndoubt if Gordon\\'s letter had said \"granaries full, can hold out till\\nEaster,\" that Lord Wolseley\\'s deliberate march--Cairo, September 27;\\nWady Halfa, October 8; Dongola, November 14; Korti, December 30;\\nMetemmah any day in February, and Khartoum, March 3, and those were\\nthe approximate dates of his grand plan of campaign--would have been\\nfully successful, and held up for admiration as a model of skill. Unfortunately, it would not do for the occasion, as Gordon was on the\\nverge of starvation and in desperate straits when the rescuing force\\nreached Dongola. It is not easy to alter the plan of any campaign, nor\\nto adapt a heavy moving machine to the work suitable for a light one. To feed 10,000 British soldiers on the middle Nile was alone a feat of\\norganisation such as no other country could have attempted, but the\\neffort was exhausting, and left no reserve energy to despatch that\\nquick-moving battalion which could have reached Gordon\\'s steamers\\nearly in December, and would have reinforced the Khartoum garrison,\\njust as Havelock and Outram did the Lucknow Residency. Dongola is only 100 miles below Debbeh, where the intelligence\\nofficers and a small force were on that 14th November; Ambukol,\\nspecially recommended by Gordon as the best starting-point, is less\\nthan fifty miles, and Korti, the point selected by Lord Wolseley, is\\nexactly that distance above Debbeh. The Bayuda desert route by the\\nJakdul Wells to Metemmah is 170 miles. At Metemmah were the five\\nsteamers with nine guns to convoy the desperately needed succour to\\nKhartoum. The energy expended on the despatch of 10,000 men up 150\\nmiles of river, if concentrated on 1000 men, must have given a\\nspeedier result, but, as the affair was managed, the last day of the\\nyear 1884 was reached before there was even that small force ready to\\nmake a dash across the desert for Metemmah. The excuses made for this, as the result proved, fatal delay of taking\\nsix weeks to do what--the forward movement from Dongola to Korti, not\\nof the main force, but of 1000 men--ought to have been done in one\\nweek, were the dearth of camels, the imperfect drill of the camel\\ncorps, and, it must be added, the exaggerated fear of the Mahdi\\'s\\npower. When it was attempted to quicken the slow forward movement of\\nthe unwieldy force confusion ensued, and no greater progress was\\neffected than if things had been left undisturbed. The erratic policy\\nin procuring camels caused them at the critical moment to be not\\nforthcoming in anything approaching the required numbers, and this\\ndifficulty was undoubtedly increased by the treachery of Mahmoud\\nKhalifa, who was the chief contractor we employed. Even when the\\ncamels were procured, they had to be broken in for regular work, and\\nthe men accustomed to the strange drill and mode of locomotion. The\\nlast reason perhaps had the most weight of all, for although the Mahdi\\nwith all his hordes had been kept at bay by Gordon single-handed, Lord\\nWolseley would risk nothing in the field. Probably the determining\\nreason for that decision was that the success of a small force would\\nhave revealed how absolutely unnecessary his large and costly\\nexpedition was. Yet events were to show beyond possibility of\\ncontraversion that this was the case, for not less than two-thirds of\\nthe force were never in any shape or form actively employed, and, as\\nfar as the fate of Gordon went, might just as well have been left at\\nhome. They had, however, to be fed and provided for at the end of a\\nline of communication of over 1200 miles. Still, notwithstanding all these delays and disadvantages, a\\nwell-equipped force of 1000 men was ready on 30th December to leave\\nKorti to cross the 170 miles of the Bayuda desert. That route was well\\nknown and well watered. There were wells at, at least, five places,\\nand the best of these was at Jakdul, about half-way across. The\\nofficer entrusted with the command was Major-General Sir Herbert\\nStewart, an officer of a gallant disposition, who was above all others\\nimpressed with the necessity of making an immediate advance, with the\\nview of throwing some help into Khartoum. Unfortunately he was\\ntrammelled by his instructions, which were to this effect--he was to\\nestablish a fort at Jakdul; but if he found an insufficiency of water\\nthere he was at liberty to press on to Metemmah. His action was to be\\ndetermined by the measure of his own necessities, not of Gordon\\'s, and\\nso Lord Wolseley arranged throughout. He reached that place with his\\n1100 fighting men, but on examining the wells and finding them full,\\nhe felt bound to obey the orders of his commander, viz. to establish\\nthe fort, and then return to Korti for a reinforcement. It was a case\\nwhen Nelson\\'s blind eye might have been called into requisition, but\\neven the most gallant officers are not Nelsons. The first advance of General Stewart to Jakdul, reached on 3rd January\\n1885, was in every respect a success. It was achieved without loss,\\nunopposed, and was quite of the nature of a surprise. The British\\nrelieving force was at last, after many months\\' report, proved to be\\na reality, and although late, it was not too late. If General Stewart\\nhad not been tied by his instructions, but left a free hand, he would\\nundoubtedly have pressed on, and a reinforcement of British troops\\nwould have entered Khartoum even before the fall of Omdurman. But it\\nmust be recorded also that Sir Herbert Stewart was not inspired by the\\nrequired flash of genius. He paid more deference to the orders of Lord\\nWolseley than to the grave peril of General Gordon. Sandra went back to the bathroom. \"Saw her!--the world is crazy, or I am--saw her swallow a powder! How\\ncould you see her do that or anything else? Hasn\\'t she been shut up in\\nthis room for twenty-four hours?\" \"Yes; but with a window like that in the roof, it isn\\'t so very\\ndifficult to see into the room, madam.\" \"Oh,\" she cried, shrinking, \"I have a spy in the house, have I? But I\\ndeserve it; I kept her imprisoned in four close walls, and never came\\nto look at her once all night. I don\\'t complain; but what was it you say\\nyou saw her take? You think she has poisoned herself, and that I had a\\nhand in it!\" \"No,\" I hastened to remark, \"he does not think you had a hand in it. He\\nsays he saw the girl herself swallow something which he believes to have\\nbeen the occasion of her death, and only asks you now where she obtained\\nit.\" I never gave her anything; didn\\'t know she had\\nanything.\" Somehow, I believed her, and so felt unwilling to prolong the present\\ninterview, especially as each moment delayed the action which I felt it\\nincumbent upon us to take. So, motioning Q to depart upon his errand, I\\ntook Mrs. Belden by the hand and endeavored to lead her from the\\nroom. But she resisted, sitting down by the side of the bed with the\\nexpression, \"I will not leave her again; do not ask it; here is my\\nplace, and here I will stay,\" while Q, obdurate for the first time,\\nstood staring severely upon us both, and would not move, though I urged\\nhim again to make haste, saying that the morning was slipping away, and\\nthat the telegram to Mr. \"Till that woman leaves the room, I don\\'t; and unless you promise to\\ntake my place in watching her, I don\\'t quit the house.\" Astonished, I left her side and crossed to him. \"You carry your suspicions too far,\" I whispered, \"and I think you are\\ntoo rude. We have seen nothing, I am sure, to warrant us in any such\\naction; besides, she can do no harm here; though, as for watching her, I\\npromise to do that much if it will relieve your mind.\" \"I don\\'t want her watched here; take her below. \"Are you not assuming a trifle the master?\" If I am, it is because I have something in my\\npossession which excuses my conduct.\" Agitated now in my turn, I held out my hand. \"Not while that woman remains in the room.\" Seeing him implacable, I returned to Mrs. \"I must entreat you to come with me,\" said I. \"'"
